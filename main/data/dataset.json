She did that alright, but what Eternity gives in longevity it takes away in legibility.It feels like her soft rose-violet formula has been stretched out, becoming longer and narrower, and all the details squeezed together. There's also an aquatic feel that makes it more streamlined, but it doesn’t do much for the quality of the rose.This was Grojsman’s sixth perfume and her first unpopular one on Basenotes. It gets 42% negative reviews (and 36% positive) and with certain exceptions, her ratings tend to go down from here on in.If you want to smell the work of Sophia Grojsman (and I urge you to do it) there are better places to start, Paris being the obvious one (the perfume not the city) and once you’ve smelled a couple of the Hug Me scents you’ll realise there’s not that much between them.Early on, I get an ashy note from the vintage parfum (which is full and in a pristine box, and made by Calvin Klein Cosmetics – not Coty) and in light of the fact that it doesn’t say anything new, except for a slight aquatic that's a wee bit scratchy, I'd say forget this and try some of the other early period works.9th June 2022275819rbakerShow all reviewsThe opening note includes a mandarin part - giving lightness and freshness- and white florals - mainly muguet. This all is combined with a whiff of a green herbal element. Bright and pleasant. Later on I get an ambery woodsiness that combines with a very soft and pale patchouli impression. I get soft sillage, adequate projection and four hours of longevity on my skin. A light daytime spring scent that starts in an agreeable fashion, but the drydown is very generic and not particularly enticing. 2.75/5. 6th February 2019212710ADVERTISEMENTdaisyvisionShow all reviewsEternity has always reminded me of something a girl next door type would wear. Spicy carnation in a bouquet of lovely florals, a splash of citruses that help freshen up the green notes. Lily of the valley is bright and clean, and is a great complement to the soft and creamy carnation. Very pleasant - it's a great, clean '90s staple fragrance. 13th June 2016173110RiveGaucheInsteadShow all reviewsI used to wear this when I was a teenager. It has a bit of a sharp smell from what I recall and barely feminine imho. I wouldn't touch it with a 10 ft pole now. 6th March 2012106168sean-dtShow all reviewsI recognise this, as I've smelled it a thousand times before but I never really noticed it. That says it all really. It's quite nice, but so what? 28th December 201081526Weimar27Show all reviewsCalvin Klein's Eternity is the coolyreserved younger Sister to Obsessionbut neverless a simply Elegant MonocromeShaped Bottle the best bottle design in my collection in my opinion. but the scent is a mixure of menthol& powder. which is not my favoriteperfume but not the worst and i think it smell to synthentic. to be my Favorite. 9th October 201078777teardropShow all reviewsl found the top notes quite similar to Eternity for Men, then it dried down into a quite ordinary white floral with no distinguishable notes to my nose. Passable as a workaday scent for a woman who simply wants to \"smell nice\", but it has zero personality or character for me.Edit; my SO bought me a bottle of this for Christmas because he likes it. lt has grown on me; it is a very smooth, \"clean\" scent, & nice for when you want to give your nose a rest from more \"challenging\" fragrances, but l only wear it occasionally to please him, it will never be one that l love.Edit; after my SO admitted that he didn't think it smelled quite right on me, it was with some relief that l sold my bottle. lt just wasn't interesting enough for me anyway! 13th September 2010101130HellywoodShow all reviewsI wear this whenever i want to feel like an adult woman not a girly girl... :) And it helps. It is such a classic and it stays on for so long. 27th February 200967838foetidusShow all reviewsI don't dislike this one as much as I used to. It used to be so much worn by so many women that it was about the only woman's fragrance I smelled, and things get annoying under those conditions. Eternity is quite floral and it keeps a good control on the floral notes  it has the tendency that the masculine Eternity has to get a little synthetic... but to a lesser degree. The florals are nice  I could do without the violet note in it, but even that doesn't bother me too much. There is some green in the opening and that's the only non floral I find in the top two levels. The base is nice too  a standard sandalwood, musk, patchouli, and amber: it's quite well balanced among the four notes. Eternity is an okay fragrance, nothing exciting, nothing annoying anymore now that it's not ubiquitous. 23rd August 20086106purplebird7Show all reviewsIt's about time that I reviewed this. I bought a bottle of Eternity when it first came out. It smelled so good in those magazine inserts. I only used about one inch of the fragrance out of the bottle before I had to give it away. I'm afraid it smelled alot better on paper than it did on me. I got alot of freesia, orange, and rose, in a big, open, airy, spicy bouquet. It was both warm and cool at the same time, but it became obnoxious on my skin, overwhelming in fact. I cannot rate it negatively, however, because it was amazing at the time, and I still sneak spritzes of it now and then at the store. I just could not own a bottle of it. 13th May 200826143kaoriShow all reviewsPopular scent I wear when I would like to assimilate with others. 19th January 200736129takemyhusbandplzShow all reviewsI used this for a brief time in high school, only because a friend of mine wore it and it smelled sooo good on her. I didn't have the chemistry for it. Not bad, but you really have to have the chemistry for it. Also, don't judge this until it warms on the skin. It's a bit hideous sniffed out of the bottle. 12th April 200621670Most reviews in the last weekmanlyscents (8)Colbourne (8)Varanis Ridari (4)Funwithfrags (4)Darvant (3)landshark321 (3)exmin (3)speedracer (3)RoamingRose (3)SPACEDOUT (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (28)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (8)Lian (7)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

Eternity is a sort of watery floral and while it does have a kind of \"functional\" household fragrance vibe to it (a detergent or liquid dish/hand soap thing) it is the only scent in our \"designer fragrances\" counter that doesn't make me recoil in horror. Yeah, it is made of nothing but cheap aromachemicals so naturally it does smell cheap (to my refined nose anyhow) but I suspect most people would find it pleasant and inoffensive. You could spend a lot more to smell a lot worse. Just try to get a bottle on sale, shouldn't be too hard. Performance-wise it is on the level of an eau de cologne. Not a bad scent if your expectations aren't very high. 23rd March 2023270898Possum-PieShow all reviewsSophia Grojsman's classic fragrance, I can't tell if I love it b/c of its quality or b/c a girlfriend wore it 27 years ago. Maybe a bit of both. I love the crisp sharp citrus and the Grojsman artistry. One of my favorite women's fragrances. 18th July 2017188971ADVERTISEMENTjimmyfresnoShow all reviewsAn elderly woman came into the building I work in and I smelled this on her and had to ask her what it was. It is the most sheer fragrance but very powerful. Until I read the reviews here I loved it, but then I recognized each of the flaws spoken about: the soapiness, the cheap rose. But it's funny, I am quite a nose and didn't detect any of these before someone mentioned them. To me, it was a fresh white tulip or daffodil fragrance, so transparent and sparkling, but the only voice in the room at its high frequency. This could easily have slipped into the white musk Aquanet hairspray territory, but it didn't. I do notice these elegant, sheer florals that only charming older women can get away with for some reason. Girls don't smell like flowers anymore, they smell like really the popular aromachemical of the season. 23rd April 2017185692jaconaShow all reviewsI recall smelling this everywhere when I was a teen, people bathed it in. Back then as much as I loved it, I'd never have bought it because everyone else was wearing it. I recently bought a bottle after rediscovering a sample and still love this scent. Fresh, green floral, a hint of citrus and spice, a bit aquatic and ethereal. I can't comment on any of the flankers, but the original is beautiful. 16th February 2017182971rskookydoughShow all reviewsMy husband surprised me with this for no reason. He probably found a good deal on ebay. My sister loved this when it first came out. I like it and I have received compliments. Its so floral and light I can go a little crazy when I spray it on. 28th May 2015157201pallyShow all reviewsIt's good but doesn't last long and very subtle.. good for romantic wear for a young minded girl. It's not amazing but I like and the girls like they described it as Romantic, Flowerly, Manlyyeah I don't get how flowers and manly work together but those are what I've been told. There is better out there though and that's why I won't be purchasing it 9th April 2013126616DebbiePope54Show all reviewsMy sister told me if you see a large number of a fragrance at TJ Max or similar clearance stores it means they're going to reformulate it or discontinue it. I saw a huge display of the original KL in the mid 80's at such a store, low & behold the scent was reformulated to something gross smelling. So when I recently saw a stack of (GASP!) Eternity bottles at TJ's I bought a couple. Yes, it's the real, original scent. Lots of light feminine notes, mostly light floral. But it can project a mile if used with a heavy hand! I hate to think this nice scent is most likely going to be changed. 4th October 2012120095sofababeShow all reviewsEternity is an instantly recognisable scent, its unique, nothing else smells like it. I love it. I'm struggling to describe the fragrance tho, so difficult to pick out individual notes but I think for me I get carnation and narcissus, some spicy notes too. I would describe it overall as a cool, clean fragrance, not overly floral. 19th March 2012106916DemeterShow all reviewsLooking over the fragrance notes, I have to laugh because my nose cannot isolate any of the listed scents. Clean, vaguely floral, but requires a delicate hand in application - it can be overwhelmingly strong. At times, this scent clashes with my body chemistry and smells almost spoiled, but gratefully, that doesn't often happen. 26th September 201198072miss millsShow all reviewsThere see to be many negative reviews of this perfume - for me, this fragrance suits my body chemistry beautifully and smells light and spicy on me. I wouldn't use more than 2 sprays, however or it could be too much. Not my favourite or signature but definitely would have a welcome place in my wardrobe anytime! 2nd July 201193755blood-orangeShow all reviewsI couldn't get over how sweet this fragrance was when I first applied it to my skin. I had expected something crisp and fresh, however what I got was something entirely different, very flowery and green.Eternity is rather soft and musky, yet quite classic and somewhat formal. In my personal opinion, I'd find this scent a little too strong for casual wear.I applaud Calvin Klein for creating a scent that would have easily re-defined fragrances in the 80's. Compared to the other scents from this decade, Eternity would have been a breath of fresh air. However, I must add that back then, and even today, Eternity is not a fragrance that will appeal to everyone.I particularly like the drydown which consists of a soft, flowery, clean skin-scent which really compliments my skin chemistry. My only criticism was that I found Eternity to smell rather similar to laundry detergent. It had that all too familiar crisp, clean, white shirt scent that for me seems a little bit predictable and common 4th June 201192301msleslieShow all reviewsI purposely avoided Calvin Klein fragrances for decades due to the suggestive ads, but now I have smelled them as part of my learning more about perfume. So I have come late to them all, and am happy to make their acquaintance. This fragrance is by Sophia Grojsman, my favorite perfumer, and in Eternity I can smell relatedness to YSL Paris, Vanderbilt, and Sun Moon Stars, each of which I like somewhat better than this one. LT in The Perfume Guide describes Eternity as 'loud rose' and 'screechy and soapy', but I guess I must enjoy those attributes! 3rd January 201181882BetsyMeszarosShow all reviewsI've noticed that many don't like this. I also saw on a discussion group that many spray 5 or 6 sprays of a fragrance. I can't imagine doing this but with the light fruity single note fragrances issued today that may be necessary. Eternity only requires a couple of sprays - 3 at the most. I hasn't worn this in about 10 years and got it out today. It is very nice. It is warm yet light. This will never be my go to fragrance but I do like it and now that I have rediscovered it will probably be using it more often. 29th September 201079062WavingWheatShow all reviewsStrong freesia floral that mellows with tim; amber and scant note sandalwood give it a very nice warm glow. A very distinguishable, unique, classic scent with incredible sillage. This is a professional lady's fragrance, not for really young girls. I recommend this FiFi winner fragrance. 24th November 200974087sameasalwaysShow all reviewsSmells really good on me. Very floral. So much so that if I had known it was floral I would have likely never tried it. Does not smell artificial on me, but rather like a big lily in a bouguet. I can see why someone might not like it..reminds me of the flowers I got when my son was born..w/lily's. The nurse who came in had to immediately leave due to being allergic. But the smell was still lovely. And it smells warm, clean, crisp lily-like in the warm summer evening. 24th December 200745118maltatudeShow all reviewsI usually steer clear of white flowers and those floral smells but I really love this perfume. I think its really in the nose of the beholder and I get compliments from both sexes. I can see how it could be abused and have the capacity to floor a small village though. 18th October 200713868sherrie11Show all reviewsI didn't care for Eternity in the 80's, but once in a blue moon I'll smell it on someone and think, \"how lovely!\". It's nice that few people wear it anymore - helps me make a less biased assessment if I'm not smelling it everywhere I go. Eternity is a nice fragrance on the right person. I like it. :-) 23rd March 200720716Aleah77Show all reviewsLight and crisp. A good fragrance for everyday casual. I haven't worn it for a while but will probably return to it someday. 22nd March 200739723scodyShow all reviewsGot this for Xmas one year back in college (early '90s) and wore it throughout my 20s -- the sage took on almost a creamy note with my chemistry. I retired it for several years (it just seemed *too* '90s to me) but started wearing it again once in awhile recently -- it comes off a little more musky/heav now than it used to. Still, occasionally nice, but it won't ever be my daytime scent again. 25th April 200620559Most reviews in the last weekColbourne (8)manlyscents (8)Funwithfrags (4)Varanis Ridari (4)landshark321 (3)exmin (3)speedracer (3)RoamingRose (3)Darvant (3)epapsiou (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (28)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)Varanis Ridari (8)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Lian (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

It can come off a bit musky and somewhat feminine. Sort of a surprise when you think Anthony Hopkins designed this. I do get compliments when I wear it, and it is a unique scent. It is not gourmand or oriental / spicy. Yet I wish it were more forward and would say \"I want to eat you!\" when I wear it. It is polite, subdued, and sophisticated. Drat! 3rd August 2022262632tesseraShow all reviewsI didn't realize this was supposed to be unisex. It's very much feminine leaning to me. I get light orange blossom with creamy undertones and tart top notes and nothing much else. It's a good orange blossom, but it's simple and a bit linear. Great fund raiser though! 8th July 2022261428ADVERTISEMENTotterlakeShow all reviewsCreated as a charity venture, AH Eau de Parfum is an unassuming, comforting scent with enough sophistication to be worthy of its namesake. AH sits in the space between designer and luxury-niche, compositionally simple and unassuming but nevertheless polished and sophisticated.Orange blossom is the key player here, making this a cozy, gently sweet floral with EDC-like facets. Bergamot and orange rind add some bite to the opening, while a smooth, background rose-jasmine combo smoothes out the mid. Herbal elements become more prominent in the fluffy, musky base.It's certainly a step up from many of the orange blossom scents positioned to it as a market peer at retail, and, considered at sale prices, it's an undeniable bargain. 26th January 2022252991Most reviews in the last weekmanlyscents (8)Colbourne (8)Varanis Ridari (4)Darvant (3)landshark321 (3)exmin (3)speedracer (3)RoamingRose (3)Funwithfrags (3)SPACEDOUT (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (28)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (8)Lian (7)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

I’m already not keen on the style, but I prefer neroli with a bit more of a greenish tinge befitting warm weather - something like Hermes Eau de Neroli Dore.As I said, though, neroli in general just isn’t for me, so AH Eau de Parfum is already barking up the wrong tree. It is soft and a bit musky, but not overly feminine. At a time, there were coupon codes floating around for 75% off, making it almost worthy of a purchase even for me. This isn’t something I’d ever wear more than once or twice a year just to remind myself why I never wear it, but I can see its merits, especially when sold for peanuts. 21st August 2024282785Most reviews in the last weekColbourne (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (4)landshark321 (3)exmin (3)speedracer (3)RoamingRose (3)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)epapsiou (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (28)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)Varanis Ridari (8)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)Zgb (7)Lian (7)sjg3839 (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

It can come off a bit musky and somewhat feminine. Sort of a surprise when you think Anthony Hopkins designed this. I do get compliments when I wear it, and it is a unique scent. It is not gourmand or oriental / spicy. Yet I wish it were more forward and would say \"I want to eat you!\" when I wear it. It is polite, subdued, and sophisticated. Drat! 3rd August 2022262632tesseraShow all reviewsI didn't realize this was supposed to be unisex. It's very much feminine leaning to me. I get light orange blossom with creamy undertones and tart top notes and nothing much else. It's a good orange blossom, but it's simple and a bit linear. Great fund raiser though! 8th July 2022261428ADVERTISEMENTotterlakeShow all reviewsCreated as a charity venture, AH Eau de Parfum is an unassuming, comforting scent with enough sophistication to be worthy of its namesake. AH sits in the space between designer and luxury-niche, compositionally simple and unassuming but nevertheless polished and sophisticated.Orange blossom is the key player here, making this a cozy, gently sweet floral with EDC-like facets. Bergamot and orange rind add some bite to the opening, while a smooth, background rose-jasmine combo smoothes out the mid. Herbal elements become more prominent in the fluffy, musky base.It's certainly a step up from many of the orange blossom scents positioned to it as a market peer at retail, and, considered at sale prices, it's an undeniable bargain. 26th January 2022252991Most reviews in the last weekColbourne (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (4)landshark321 (3)exmin (3)speedracer (3)RoamingRose (3)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)sakecat (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (28)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (8)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Lian (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

I’m already not keen on the style, but I prefer neroli with a bit more of a greenish tinge befitting warm weather - something like Hermes Eau de Neroli Dore.As I said, though, neroli in general just isn’t for me, so AH Eau de Parfum is already barking up the wrong tree. It is soft and a bit musky, but not overly feminine. At a time, there were coupon codes floating around for 75% off, making it almost worthy of a purchase even for me. This isn’t something I’d ever wear more than once or twice a year just to remind myself why I never wear it, but I can see its merits, especially when sold for peanuts. 21st August 2024282785Most reviews in the last weekColbourne (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (4)landshark321 (3)exmin (3)speedracer (3)RoamingRose (3)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)epapsiou (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (28)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (8)Funwithfrags (8)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Lian (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

Eternity is a sort of watery floral and while it does have a kind of \"functional\" household fragrance vibe to it (a detergent or liquid dish/hand soap thing) it is the only scent in our \"designer fragrances\" counter that doesn't make me recoil in horror. Yeah, it is made of nothing but cheap aromachemicals so naturally it does smell cheap (to my refined nose anyhow) but I suspect most people would find it pleasant and inoffensive. You could spend a lot more to smell a lot worse. Just try to get a bottle on sale, shouldn't be too hard. Performance-wise it is on the level of an eau de cologne. Not a bad scent if your expectations aren't very high. 23rd March 2023270898Possum-PieShow all reviewsSophia Grojsman's classic fragrance, I can't tell if I love it b/c of its quality or b/c a girlfriend wore it 27 years ago. Maybe a bit of both. I love the crisp sharp citrus and the Grojsman artistry. One of my favorite women's fragrances. 18th July 2017188971ADVERTISEMENTjimmyfresnoShow all reviewsAn elderly woman came into the building I work in and I smelled this on her and had to ask her what it was. It is the most sheer fragrance but very powerful. Until I read the reviews here I loved it, but then I recognized each of the flaws spoken about: the soapiness, the cheap rose. But it's funny, I am quite a nose and didn't detect any of these before someone mentioned them. To me, it was a fresh white tulip or daffodil fragrance, so transparent and sparkling, but the only voice in the room at its high frequency. This could easily have slipped into the white musk Aquanet hairspray territory, but it didn't. I do notice these elegant, sheer florals that only charming older women can get away with for some reason. Girls don't smell like flowers anymore, they smell like really the popular aromachemical of the season. 23rd April 2017185692jaconaShow all reviewsI recall smelling this everywhere when I was a teen, people bathed it in. Back then as much as I loved it, I'd never have bought it because everyone else was wearing it. I recently bought a bottle after rediscovering a sample and still love this scent. Fresh, green floral, a hint of citrus and spice, a bit aquatic and ethereal. I can't comment on any of the flankers, but the original is beautiful. 16th February 2017182971rskookydoughShow all reviewsMy husband surprised me with this for no reason. He probably found a good deal on ebay. My sister loved this when it first came out. I like it and I have received compliments. Its so floral and light I can go a little crazy when I spray it on. 28th May 2015157201pallyShow all reviewsIt's good but doesn't last long and very subtle.. good for romantic wear for a young minded girl. It's not amazing but I like and the girls like they described it as Romantic, Flowerly, Manlyyeah I don't get how flowers and manly work together but those are what I've been told. There is better out there though and that's why I won't be purchasing it 9th April 2013126616DebbiePope54Show all reviewsMy sister told me if you see a large number of a fragrance at TJ Max or similar clearance stores it means they're going to reformulate it or discontinue it. I saw a huge display of the original KL in the mid 80's at such a store, low & behold the scent was reformulated to something gross smelling. So when I recently saw a stack of (GASP!) Eternity bottles at TJ's I bought a couple. Yes, it's the real, original scent. Lots of light feminine notes, mostly light floral. But it can project a mile if used with a heavy hand! I hate to think this nice scent is most likely going to be changed. 4th October 2012120095sofababeShow all reviewsEternity is an instantly recognisable scent, its unique, nothing else smells like it. I love it. I'm struggling to describe the fragrance tho, so difficult to pick out individual notes but I think for me I get carnation and narcissus, some spicy notes too. I would describe it overall as a cool, clean fragrance, not overly floral. 19th March 2012106916DemeterShow all reviewsLooking over the fragrance notes, I have to laugh because my nose cannot isolate any of the listed scents. Clean, vaguely floral, but requires a delicate hand in application - it can be overwhelmingly strong. At times, this scent clashes with my body chemistry and smells almost spoiled, but gratefully, that doesn't often happen. 26th September 201198072miss millsShow all reviewsThere see to be many negative reviews of this perfume - for me, this fragrance suits my body chemistry beautifully and smells light and spicy on me. I wouldn't use more than 2 sprays, however or it could be too much. Not my favourite or signature but definitely would have a welcome place in my wardrobe anytime! 2nd July 201193755blood-orangeShow all reviewsI couldn't get over how sweet this fragrance was when I first applied it to my skin. I had expected something crisp and fresh, however what I got was something entirely different, very flowery and green.Eternity is rather soft and musky, yet quite classic and somewhat formal. In my personal opinion, I'd find this scent a little too strong for casual wear.I applaud Calvin Klein for creating a scent that would have easily re-defined fragrances in the 80's. Compared to the other scents from this decade, Eternity would have been a breath of fresh air. However, I must add that back then, and even today, Eternity is not a fragrance that will appeal to everyone.I particularly like the drydown which consists of a soft, flowery, clean skin-scent which really compliments my skin chemistry. My only criticism was that I found Eternity to smell rather similar to laundry detergent. It had that all too familiar crisp, clean, white shirt scent that for me seems a little bit predictable and common 4th June 201192301msleslieShow all reviewsI purposely avoided Calvin Klein fragrances for decades due to the suggestive ads, but now I have smelled them as part of my learning more about perfume. So I have come late to them all, and am happy to make their acquaintance. This fragrance is by Sophia Grojsman, my favorite perfumer, and in Eternity I can smell relatedness to YSL Paris, Vanderbilt, and Sun Moon Stars, each of which I like somewhat better than this one. LT in The Perfume Guide describes Eternity as 'loud rose' and 'screechy and soapy', but I guess I must enjoy those attributes! 3rd January 201181882BetsyMeszarosShow all reviewsI've noticed that many don't like this. I also saw on a discussion group that many spray 5 or 6 sprays of a fragrance. I can't imagine doing this but with the light fruity single note fragrances issued today that may be necessary. Eternity only requires a couple of sprays - 3 at the most. I hasn't worn this in about 10 years and got it out today. It is very nice. It is warm yet light. This will never be my go to fragrance but I do like it and now that I have rediscovered it will probably be using it more often. 29th September 201079062WavingWheatShow all reviewsStrong freesia floral that mellows with tim; amber and scant note sandalwood give it a very nice warm glow. A very distinguishable, unique, classic scent with incredible sillage. This is a professional lady's fragrance, not for really young girls. I recommend this FiFi winner fragrance. 24th November 200974087sameasalwaysShow all reviewsSmells really good on me. Very floral. So much so that if I had known it was floral I would have likely never tried it. Does not smell artificial on me, but rather like a big lily in a bouguet. I can see why someone might not like it..reminds me of the flowers I got when my son was born..w/lily's. The nurse who came in had to immediately leave due to being allergic. But the smell was still lovely. And it smells warm, clean, crisp lily-like in the warm summer evening. 24th December 200745118maltatudeShow all reviewsI usually steer clear of white flowers and those floral smells but I really love this perfume. I think its really in the nose of the beholder and I get compliments from both sexes. I can see how it could be abused and have the capacity to floor a small village though. 18th October 200713868sherrie11Show all reviewsI didn't care for Eternity in the 80's, but once in a blue moon I'll smell it on someone and think, \"how lovely!\". It's nice that few people wear it anymore - helps me make a less biased assessment if I'm not smelling it everywhere I go. Eternity is a nice fragrance on the right person. I like it. :-) 23rd March 200720716Aleah77Show all reviewsLight and crisp. A good fragrance for everyday casual. I haven't worn it for a while but will probably return to it someday. 22nd March 200739723scodyShow all reviewsGot this for Xmas one year back in college (early '90s) and wore it throughout my 20s -- the sage took on almost a creamy note with my chemistry. I retired it for several years (it just seemed *too* '90s to me) but started wearing it again once in awhile recently -- it comes off a little more musky/heav now than it used to. Still, occasionally nice, but it won't ever be my daytime scent again. 25th April 200620559Most reviews in the last weekColbourne (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (4)landshark321 (3)exmin (3)speedracer (3)RoamingRose (3)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)sakecat (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (28)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (8)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Lian (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

She did that alright, but what Eternity gives in longevity it takes away in legibility.It feels like her soft rose-violet formula has been stretched out, becoming longer and narrower, and all the details squeezed together. There's also an aquatic feel that makes it more streamlined, but it doesn’t do much for the quality of the rose.This was Grojsman’s sixth perfume and her first unpopular one on Basenotes. It gets 42% negative reviews (and 36% positive) and with certain exceptions, her ratings tend to go down from here on in.If you want to smell the work of Sophia Grojsman (and I urge you to do it) there are better places to start, Paris being the obvious one (the perfume not the city) and once you’ve smelled a couple of the Hug Me scents you’ll realise there’s not that much between them.Early on, I get an ashy note from the vintage parfum (which is full and in a pristine box, and made by Calvin Klein Cosmetics – not Coty) and in light of the fact that it doesn’t say anything new, except for a slight aquatic that's a wee bit scratchy, I'd say forget this and try some of the other early period works.9th June 2022275819rbakerShow all reviewsThe opening note includes a mandarin part - giving lightness and freshness- and white florals - mainly muguet. This all is combined with a whiff of a green herbal element. Bright and pleasant. Later on I get an ambery woodsiness that combines with a very soft and pale patchouli impression. I get soft sillage, adequate projection and four hours of longevity on my skin. A light daytime spring scent that starts in an agreeable fashion, but the drydown is very generic and not particularly enticing. 2.75/5. 6th February 2019212710ADVERTISEMENTdaisyvisionShow all reviewsEternity has always reminded me of something a girl next door type would wear. Spicy carnation in a bouquet of lovely florals, a splash of citruses that help freshen up the green notes. Lily of the valley is bright and clean, and is a great complement to the soft and creamy carnation. Very pleasant - it's a great, clean '90s staple fragrance. 13th June 2016173110RiveGaucheInsteadShow all reviewsI used to wear this when I was a teenager.

I wouldn't touch it with a 10 ft pole now. 6th March 2012106168sean-dtShow all reviewsI recognise this, as I've smelled it a thousand times before but I never really noticed it.

Passable as a workaday scent for a woman who simply wants to \"smell nice\", but it has zero personality or character for me.Edit; my SO bought me a bottle of this for Christmas because he likes it. lt has grown on me; it is a very smooth, \"clean\" scent, & nice for when you want to give your nose a rest from more \"challenging\" fragrances, but l only wear it occasionally to please him, it will never be one that l love.Edit; after my SO admitted that he didn't think it smelled quite right on me, it was with some relief that l sold my bottle. lt just wasn't interesting enough for me anyway! 13th September 2010101130HellywoodShow all reviewsI wear this whenever i want to feel like an adult woman not a girly girl... :) And it helps. It is such a classic and it stays on for so long. 27th February 200967838foetidusShow all reviewsI don't dislike this one as much as I used to. It used to be so much worn by so many women that it was about the only woman's fragrance I smelled, and things get annoying under those conditions. Eternity is quite floral and it keeps a good control on the floral notes  it has the tendency that the masculine Eternity has to get a little synthetic... but to a lesser degree. The florals are nice  I could do without the violet note in it, but even that doesn't bother me too much. There is some green in the opening and that's the only non floral I find in the top two levels. The base is nice too  a standard sandalwood, musk, patchouli, and amber: it's quite well balanced among the four notes. Eternity is an okay fragrance, nothing exciting, nothing annoying anymore now that it's not ubiquitous. 23rd August 20086106purplebird7Show all reviewsIt's about time that I reviewed this. I bought a bottle of Eternity when it first came out. It smelled so good in those magazine inserts. I only used about one inch of the fragrance out of the bottle before I had to give it away. I'm afraid it smelled alot better on paper than it did on me. I got alot of freesia, orange, and rose, in a big, open, airy, spicy bouquet. It was both warm and cool at the same time, but it became obnoxious on my skin, overwhelming in fact. I cannot rate it negatively, however, because it was amazing at the time, and I still sneak spritzes of it now and then at the store. I just could not own a bottle of it. 13th May 200826143kaoriShow all reviewsPopular scent I wear when I would like to assimilate with others. 19th January 200736129takemyhusbandplzShow all reviewsI used this for a brief time in high school, only because a friend of mine wore it and it smelled sooo good on her. I didn't have the chemistry for it. Not bad, but you really have to have the chemistry for it. Also, don't judge this until it warms on the skin. It's a bit hideous sniffed out of the bottle. 12th April 200621670Most reviews in the last weekmanlyscents (8)Colbourne (8)Varanis Ridari (4)speedracer (3)RoamingRose (3)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)landshark321 (3)exmin (3)SPACEDOUT (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (28)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (8)Lian (7)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

While I'm not overly fond of any of Grojsman's essays on this theme, Eternity represents the weakest entry I have yet encountered.In this case, the whole concoction just feels cheap. The fruit accord is crude, harsh and artificial, without the plush lactonic accents that give scents like Yvresse and Kashâya their enveloping sense of indulgent luxury. What finally lets Eternity down though is the quality of its rose, which is too shrill, bitter, and soapy to tolerate over several hours of wear. I also find the rose excruciatingly loud, especially in the eau de parfum concentration. My takeaway impression is cheap, crude, and nasty.13th June 2014141729bnusrShow all reviewsThe one and only perfume I truly can't stand. I had some house guests it must be about 20 years ago and one of them reeked of this. It smelled to me a mixture of arrogant and urinal-like. The 'arrogant' didn't come from the wearer who was a perfectly pleasant if somewhat overly conventional girl. I agree with Darvant about the gaminess, which coupled with the sharpness make it rank. I honestly can't even stay in the room with anyone wearing this, and the sillage must be unrivalled. I get it from a mile away.Overall impression; urine of a cyborg animal; indended for territorial marking. 31st January 2013123570ADVERTISEMENTDarvantShow all reviewsI don't particularly love this familiar and basically sharp fragrance that smells to me a bit dissonant, almost sweaty and synthetic. The mix is really floral with hints of green notes, citrus (mostly orange), some spices (a touch of cinnamon, cloves?), introducing a woody/musky base with just a touch of amber. The dry down is mostly sandalwood and musk under my nose. I detect some simil cherry synthetic fruity note in contrast with some green sharp element and the floral combination is deep and pungent. Penetrating floral notes (the lily effect is dominant to me together with the one from freesia), synthetic fruits, heady patchouli and a pronounced woody vibe are too powerful and unbalanced to me, producing a final dissonance. The final effect is too cloying, detergent kind and sweaty. 16th December 2012121276yumcheesyShow all reviewsI won a bottle of this- it smells ok but when I sprayed it, it was like bug spray and I couldn't wash it off fast enough! It's super strong and kind of like a floor cleaner, maybe? Yuck. 10th August 2012114876BLAQShow all reviews3.4 oz. Gifted.I received Eternity as my very first fragrance a long time ago. Being my first bottle, I have never thrown it away.. However, I have not worn it in years either. It simply does not smell good to me.The sage notes alone, stand out, amidst the alcoholic mess. I sprayed some an hour ago to write this review and I hate it today as much as I did years ago. 2nd July 2012113036nonnativeShow all reviewsIt's strange how I loved it and how I now hate it. In the 80s I considered it modern, classy and light. Now it seems very old, dated and incredibly innatural. But a friend of mine finds it irresistible and wear it everyday. This is the kind of perfume that is so strong and long lasting to cover a woman's personality completely. Can it be a comfort for shy ladies? 23rd October 200961965hagertygalShow all reviewsICK. I bought this in college, when it was the \"in\" fragrance. I didn't like it then, and still do not. Eternity is a good name for it, but it doesn't say \"where\" your eternity will be spent while wearing it. How about the hot inferno of Hell? It is definately a floral scent, but all I ever smell in it is Lilly of the Valley. No, no, no. Eternity is the reason I cannot, to this day, ever stand the smell of Lilly of the Valley in anything, even a scented candle. Like many other Calvin Klein scents, this one stays on my skin and in my nose forever, leaving me with a headache. 1st August 200971128MFJShow all reviewsI am not sure if Eternity was meant to compliment her male counterpart, but I seriously doubt so. Eternity for Men is far from horrible. This is a very thick, plastic, heady, stuffy, and overly-sweet floral scent. Unfortunately, a signature scent of one of my favorite aunts. 23rd May 200956442KluteShow all reviewsThis scent is just absolutely atrocious. It has a cloying, sharp, fake powdery smell. In summer it does not do well at all with sweat, but just turns bitter and even sharper and just simply makes you gag. A friend of mine who wears this actually noticed that I seem to flinch away from her when she comes too close.... 29th March 200968372tvlampboyShow all reviewsA very dated white floral that always fails to wow me. Try as I have to like Eternity for Women, I've always ended up finding something in it cloying and synthetic. It should (IMHO) be light and airy and crisp, but it always seems to end up smelling very heavy and fake.A failed experiment from CK. 28th December 200829069jredmanShow all reviewsI loved this while in college. Unfor, this was the fragrance I was wearing when the love of my life dumped me. He later regretted it - after I was gone but I cannot stand it now. Brings back that heartache that will never be completely gone. I thought it was nice before although looking back, certainly not a sophisticated scent or one that I truly would have kept wearing anyhow. 13th December 200862006TrufflesShow all reviewsI think this smells horrible and I really can't work out why anybody would like it. Just one big strange fake horrible smell, yuck. 20th October 200862064jalexhrovatShow all reviewsComplete turn off for me. I thought this would be much better than what I experienced. Most would say its better than the male counterpart, but I think this wasn't even close. Smelled like an astringent to me...but maybe I didn't give it enough of a chance to open up to me. Oh well...probably wouldn't have been very impressed either way.Thumbs down. 3rd September 200855818melancholic-botanistShow all reviewsSynthetic cherries + cloves + white lilies. Cold.

Another one I hope to swap. 5th April 200739968TDDanaeShow all reviewsI have never liked Eternity. I was walking down Rodeo Drive one day (not that I belong there) sight seeing. I wondered how the rich shopped and a very rich looking young woman rushed by reeking to high heavens with this scent. It doesn't smell like what they say is in it. It smells very strong and just plain sour. Not like a floral, but a bunch of very sour pungent apricots. 4th October 200631267annemShow all reviewsSeems very sickly to me, like having sugar in coffee.

I've tried it a few different times but am always disappointed. 21st March 200623515FroFroShow all reviewsNot one of my favorites. I don't feel as strongly about it as the previous reviewer, JimInCO, however. I used it for a very short period when it just came out, and it never really \"took\", nor did any of it's \"modifications\", perhaps except for \"Eternity Summer\", which I found to be quite pleasant. 30th January 20068547JimInCOShow all reviewsWhenever a woman (known or unknown to me), wears this stuff I walk the other way. Particularly if she fails to shower. This stuff is the bomb (and I am not using the Hip-Hop use of the term either!) This reeks of a multitude of sickly sheep p****ing in a flower garden.

Eternity is a sort of watery floral and while it does have a kind of \"functional\" household fragrance vibe to it (a detergent or liquid dish/hand soap thing) it is the only scent in our \"designer fragrances\" counter that doesn't make me recoil in horror. Yeah, it is made of nothing but cheap aromachemicals so naturally it does smell cheap (to my refined nose anyhow) but I suspect most people would find it pleasant and inoffensive. You could spend a lot more to smell a lot worse. Just try to get a bottle on sale, shouldn't be too hard. Performance-wise it is on the level of an eau de cologne. Not a bad scent if your expectations aren't very high. 23rd March 2023270898Possum-PieShow all reviewsSophia Grojsman's classic fragrance, I can't tell if I love it b/c of its quality or b/c a girlfriend wore it 27 years ago. Maybe a bit of both. I love the crisp sharp citrus and the Grojsman artistry. One of my favorite women's fragrances. 18th July 2017188971ADVERTISEMENTjimmyfresnoShow all reviewsAn elderly woman came into the building I work in and I smelled this on her and had to ask her what it was. It is the most sheer fragrance but very powerful. Until I read the reviews here I loved it, but then I recognized each of the flaws spoken about: the soapiness, the cheap rose. But it's funny, I am quite a nose and didn't detect any of these before someone mentioned them. To me, it was a fresh white tulip or daffodil fragrance, so transparent and sparkling, but the only voice in the room at its high frequency. This could easily have slipped into the white musk Aquanet hairspray territory, but it didn't. I do notice these elegant, sheer florals that only charming older women can get away with for some reason. Girls don't smell like flowers anymore, they smell like really the popular aromachemical of the season. 23rd April 2017185692jaconaShow all reviewsI recall smelling this everywhere when I was a teen, people bathed it in. Back then as much as I loved it, I'd never have bought it because everyone else was wearing it. I recently bought a bottle after rediscovering a sample and still love this scent. Fresh, green floral, a hint of citrus and spice, a bit aquatic and ethereal. I can't comment on any of the flankers, but the original is beautiful. 16th February 2017182971rskookydoughShow all reviewsMy husband surprised me with this for no reason. He probably found a good deal on ebay. My sister loved this when it first came out. I like it and I have received compliments. Its so floral and light I can go a little crazy when I spray it on. 28th May 2015157201pallyShow all reviewsIt's good but doesn't last long and very subtle.. good for romantic wear for a young minded girl. It's not amazing but I like and the girls like they described it as Romantic, Flowerly, Manlyyeah I don't get how flowers and manly work together but those are what I've been told. There is better out there though and that's why I won't be purchasing it 9th April 2013126616DebbiePope54Show all reviewsMy sister told me if you see a large number of a fragrance at TJ Max or similar clearance stores it means they're going to reformulate it or discontinue it. I saw a huge display of the original KL in the mid 80's at such a store, low & behold the scent was reformulated to something gross smelling. So when I recently saw a stack of (GASP!) Eternity bottles at TJ's I bought a couple. Yes, it's the real, original scent. Lots of light feminine notes, mostly light floral. But it can project a mile if used with a heavy hand! I hate to think this nice scent is most likely going to be changed. 4th October 2012120095sofababeShow all reviewsEternity is an instantly recognisable scent, its unique, nothing else smells like it. I love it. I'm struggling to describe the fragrance tho, so difficult to pick out individual notes but I think for me I get carnation and narcissus, some spicy notes too. I would describe it overall as a cool, clean fragrance, not overly floral. 19th March 2012106916DemeterShow all reviewsLooking over the fragrance notes, I have to laugh because my nose cannot isolate any of the listed scents. Clean, vaguely floral, but requires a delicate hand in application - it can be overwhelmingly strong. At times, this scent clashes with my body chemistry and smells almost spoiled, but gratefully, that doesn't often happen. 26th September 201198072miss millsShow all reviewsThere see to be many negative reviews of this perfume - for me, this fragrance suits my body chemistry beautifully and smells light and spicy on me. I wouldn't use more than 2 sprays, however or it could be too much. Not my favourite or signature but definitely would have a welcome place in my wardrobe anytime! 2nd July 201193755blood-orangeShow all reviewsI couldn't get over how sweet this fragrance was when I first applied it to my skin. I had expected something crisp and fresh, however what I got was something entirely different, very flowery and green.Eternity is rather soft and musky, yet quite classic and somewhat formal. In my personal opinion, I'd find this scent a little too strong for casual wear.I applaud Calvin Klein for creating a scent that would have easily re-defined fragrances in the 80's. Compared to the other scents from this decade, Eternity would have been a breath of fresh air. However, I must add that back then, and even today, Eternity is not a fragrance that will appeal to everyone.I particularly like the drydown which consists of a soft, flowery, clean skin-scent which really compliments my skin chemistry. My only criticism was that I found Eternity to smell rather similar to laundry detergent. It had that all too familiar crisp, clean, white shirt scent that for me seems a little bit predictable and common 4th June 201192301msleslieShow all reviewsI purposely avoided Calvin Klein fragrances for decades due to the suggestive ads, but now I have smelled them as part of my learning more about perfume. So I have come late to them all, and am happy to make their acquaintance. This fragrance is by Sophia Grojsman, my favorite perfumer, and in Eternity I can smell relatedness to YSL Paris, Vanderbilt, and Sun Moon Stars, each of which I like somewhat better than this one. LT in The Perfume Guide describes Eternity as 'loud rose' and 'screechy and soapy', but I guess I must enjoy those attributes! 3rd January 201181882BetsyMeszarosShow all reviewsI've noticed that many don't like this. I also saw on a discussion group that many spray 5 or 6 sprays of a fragrance. I can't imagine doing this but with the light fruity single note fragrances issued today that may be necessary. Eternity only requires a couple of sprays - 3 at the most. I hasn't worn this in about 10 years and got it out today. It is very nice. It is warm yet light. This will never be my go to fragrance but I do like it and now that I have rediscovered it will probably be using it more often. 29th September 201079062WavingWheatShow all reviewsStrong freesia floral that mellows with tim; amber and scant note sandalwood give it a very nice warm glow. A very distinguishable, unique, classic scent with incredible sillage. This is a professional lady's fragrance, not for really young girls. I recommend this FiFi winner fragrance. 24th November 200974087sameasalwaysShow all reviewsSmells really good on me. Very floral. So much so that if I had known it was floral I would have likely never tried it. Does not smell artificial on me, but rather like a big lily in a bouguet. I can see why someone might not like it..reminds me of the flowers I got when my son was born..w/lily's. The nurse who came in had to immediately leave due to being allergic. But the smell was still lovely. And it smells warm, clean, crisp lily-like in the warm summer evening. 24th December 200745118maltatudeShow all reviewsI usually steer clear of white flowers and those floral smells but I really love this perfume. I think its really in the nose of the beholder and I get compliments from both sexes. I can see how it could be abused and have the capacity to floor a small village though. 18th October 200713868sherrie11Show all reviewsI didn't care for Eternity in the 80's, but once in a blue moon I'll smell it on someone and think, \"how lovely!\". It's nice that few people wear it anymore - helps me make a less biased assessment if I'm not smelling it everywhere I go. Eternity is a nice fragrance on the right person. I like it. :-) 23rd March 200720716Aleah77Show all reviewsLight and crisp. A good fragrance for everyday casual. I haven't worn it for a while but will probably return to it someday. 22nd March 200739723scodyShow all reviewsGot this for Xmas one year back in college (early '90s) and wore it throughout my 20s -- the sage took on almost a creamy note with my chemistry. I retired it for several years (it just seemed *too* '90s to me) but started wearing it again once in awhile recently -- it comes off a little more musky/heav now than it used to. Still, occasionally nice, but it won't ever be my daytime scent again. 25th April 200620559Most reviews in the last weekColbourne (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (4)landshark321 (3)exmin (3)speedracer (3)RoamingRose (3)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)sakecat (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (28)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (8)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Lian (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

She did that alright, but what Eternity gives in longevity it takes away in legibility.It feels like her soft rose-violet formula has been stretched out, becoming longer and narrower, and all the details squeezed together. There's also an aquatic feel that makes it more streamlined, but it doesn’t do much for the quality of the rose.This was Grojsman’s sixth perfume and her first unpopular one on Basenotes. It gets 42% negative reviews (and 36% positive) and with certain exceptions, her ratings tend to go down from here on in.If you want to smell the work of Sophia Grojsman (and I urge you to do it) there are better places to start, Paris being the obvious one (the perfume not the city) and once you’ve smelled a couple of the Hug Me scents you’ll realise there’s not that much between them.Early on, I get an ashy note from the vintage parfum (which is full and in a pristine box, and made by Calvin Klein Cosmetics – not Coty) and in light of the fact that it doesn’t say anything new, except for a slight aquatic that's a wee bit scratchy, I'd say forget this and try some of the other early period works.9th June 2022275819rbakerShow all reviewsThe opening note includes a mandarin part - giving lightness and freshness- and white florals - mainly muguet. This all is combined with a whiff of a green herbal element. Bright and pleasant. Later on I get an ambery woodsiness that combines with a very soft and pale patchouli impression. I get soft sillage, adequate projection and four hours of longevity on my skin. A light daytime spring scent that starts in an agreeable fashion, but the drydown is very generic and not particularly enticing. 2.75/5. 6th February 2019212710ADVERTISEMENTdaisyvisionShow all reviewsEternity has always reminded me of something a girl next door type would wear. Spicy carnation in a bouquet of lovely florals, a splash of citruses that help freshen up the green notes. Lily of the valley is bright and clean, and is a great complement to the soft and creamy carnation. Very pleasant - it's a great, clean '90s staple fragrance. 13th June 2016173110RiveGaucheInsteadShow all reviewsI used to wear this when I was a teenager. It has a bit of a sharp smell from what I recall and barely feminine imho. I wouldn't touch it with a 10 ft pole now. 6th March 2012106168sean-dtShow all reviewsI recognise this, as I've smelled it a thousand times before but I never really noticed it.

Passable as a workaday scent for a woman who simply wants to \"smell nice\", but it has zero personality or character for me.Edit; my SO bought me a bottle of this for Christmas because he likes it. lt has grown on me; it is a very smooth, \"clean\" scent, & nice for when you want to give your nose a rest from more \"challenging\" fragrances, but l only wear it occasionally to please him, it will never be one that l love.Edit; after my SO admitted that he didn't think it smelled quite right on me, it was with some relief that l sold my bottle. lt just wasn't interesting enough for me anyway! 13th September 2010101130HellywoodShow all reviewsI wear this whenever i want to feel like an adult woman not a girly girl... :) And it helps. It is such a classic and it stays on for so long. 27th February 200967838foetidusShow all reviewsI don't dislike this one as much as I used to. It used to be so much worn by so many women that it was about the only woman's fragrance I smelled, and things get annoying under those conditions. Eternity is quite floral and it keeps a good control on the floral notes  it has the tendency that the masculine Eternity has to get a little synthetic... but to a lesser degree. The florals are nice  I could do without the violet note in it, but even that doesn't bother me too much. There is some green in the opening and that's the only non floral I find in the top two levels. The base is nice too  a standard sandalwood, musk, patchouli, and amber: it's quite well balanced among the four notes. Eternity is an okay fragrance, nothing exciting, nothing annoying anymore now that it's not ubiquitous. 23rd August 20086106purplebird7Show all reviewsIt's about time that I reviewed this. I bought a bottle of Eternity when it first came out. It smelled so good in those magazine inserts. I only used about one inch of the fragrance out of the bottle before I had to give it away. I'm afraid it smelled alot better on paper than it did on me. I got alot of freesia, orange, and rose, in a big, open, airy, spicy bouquet. It was both warm and cool at the same time, but it became obnoxious on my skin, overwhelming in fact. I cannot rate it negatively, however, because it was amazing at the time, and I still sneak spritzes of it now and then at the store. I just could not own a bottle of it. 13th May 200826143kaoriShow all reviewsPopular scent I wear when I would like to assimilate with others. 19th January 200736129takemyhusbandplzShow all reviewsI used this for a brief time in high school, only because a friend of mine wore it and it smelled sooo good on her. I didn't have the chemistry for it. Not bad, but you really have to have the chemistry for it. Also, don't judge this until it warms on the skin. It's a bit hideous sniffed out of the bottle. 12th April 200621670Most reviews in the last weekColbourne (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (4)landshark321 (3)exmin (3)speedracer (3)RoamingRose (3)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)epapsiou (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (28)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (8)Funwithfrags (8)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Lian (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

While I'm not overly fond of any of Grojsman's essays on this theme, Eternity represents the weakest entry I have yet encountered.In this case, the whole concoction just feels cheap. The fruit accord is crude, harsh and artificial, without the plush lactonic accents that give scents like Yvresse and Kashâya their enveloping sense of indulgent luxury. What finally lets Eternity down though is the quality of its rose, which is too shrill, bitter, and soapy to tolerate over several hours of wear. I also find the rose excruciatingly loud, especially in the eau de parfum concentration. My takeaway impression is cheap, crude, and nasty.13th June 2014141729bnusrShow all reviewsThe one and only perfume I truly can't stand. I had some house guests it must be about 20 years ago and one of them reeked of this. It smelled to me a mixture of arrogant and urinal-like. The 'arrogant' didn't come from the wearer who was a perfectly pleasant if somewhat overly conventional girl. I agree with Darvant about the gaminess, which coupled with the sharpness make it rank. I honestly can't even stay in the room with anyone wearing this, and the sillage must be unrivalled. I get it from a mile away.Overall impression; urine of a cyborg animal; indended for territorial marking. 31st January 2013123570ADVERTISEMENTDarvantShow all reviewsI don't particularly love this familiar and basically sharp fragrance that smells to me a bit dissonant, almost sweaty and synthetic. The mix is really floral with hints of green notes, citrus (mostly orange), some spices (a touch of cinnamon, cloves?), introducing a woody/musky base with just a touch of amber. The dry down is mostly sandalwood and musk under my nose. I detect some simil cherry synthetic fruity note in contrast with some green sharp element and the floral combination is deep and pungent. Penetrating floral notes (the lily effect is dominant to me together with the one from freesia), synthetic fruits, heady patchouli and a pronounced woody vibe are too powerful and unbalanced to me, producing a final dissonance. The final effect is too cloying, detergent kind and sweaty. 16th December 2012121276yumcheesyShow all reviewsI won a bottle of this- it smells ok but when I sprayed it, it was like bug spray and I couldn't wash it off fast enough! It's super strong and kind of like a floor cleaner, maybe? Yuck. 10th August 2012114876BLAQShow all reviews3.4 oz. Gifted.I received Eternity as my very first fragrance a long time ago. Being my first bottle, I have never thrown it away.. However, I have not worn it in years either. It simply does not smell good to me.The sage notes alone, stand out, amidst the alcoholic mess. I sprayed some an hour ago to write this review and I hate it today as much as I did years ago. 2nd July 2012113036nonnativeShow all reviewsIt's strange how I loved it and how I now hate it. In the 80s I considered it modern, classy and light. Now it seems very old, dated and incredibly innatural. But a friend of mine finds it irresistible and wear it everyday. This is the kind of perfume that is so strong and long lasting to cover a woman's personality completely. Can it be a comfort for shy ladies? 23rd October 200961965hagertygalShow all reviewsICK. I bought this in college, when it was the \"in\" fragrance. I didn't like it then, and still do not. Eternity is a good name for it, but it doesn't say \"where\" your eternity will be spent while wearing it. How about the hot inferno of Hell? It is definately a floral scent, but all I ever smell in it is Lilly of the Valley. No, no, no. Eternity is the reason I cannot, to this day, ever stand the smell of Lilly of the Valley in anything, even a scented candle. Like many other Calvin Klein scents, this one stays on my skin and in my nose forever, leaving me with a headache. 1st August 200971128MFJShow all reviewsI am not sure if Eternity was meant to compliment her male counterpart, but I seriously doubt so. Eternity for Men is far from horrible. This is a very thick, plastic, heady, stuffy, and overly-sweet floral scent. Unfortunately, a signature scent of one of my favorite aunts. 23rd May 200956442KluteShow all reviewsThis scent is just absolutely atrocious. It has a cloying, sharp, fake powdery smell. In summer it does not do well at all with sweat, but just turns bitter and even sharper and just simply makes you gag. A friend of mine who wears this actually noticed that I seem to flinch away from her when she comes too close.... 29th March 200968372tvlampboyShow all reviewsA very dated white floral that always fails to wow me. Try as I have to like Eternity for Women, I've always ended up finding something in it cloying and synthetic. It should (IMHO) be light and airy and crisp, but it always seems to end up smelling very heavy and fake.A failed experiment from CK. 28th December 200829069jredmanShow all reviewsI loved this while in college. Unfor, this was the fragrance I was wearing when the love of my life dumped me. He later regretted it - after I was gone but I cannot stand it now. Brings back that heartache that will never be completely gone. I thought it was nice before although looking back, certainly not a sophisticated scent or one that I truly would have kept wearing anyhow. 13th December 200862006TrufflesShow all reviewsI think this smells horrible and I really can't work out why anybody would like it. Just one big strange fake horrible smell, yuck. 20th October 200862064jalexhrovatShow all reviewsComplete turn off for me. I thought this would be much better than what I experienced. Most would say its better than the male counterpart, but I think this wasn't even close. Smelled like an astringent to me...but maybe I didn't give it enough of a chance to open up to me. Oh well...probably wouldn't have been very impressed either way.Thumbs down. 3rd September 200855818melancholic-botanistShow all reviewsSynthetic cherries + cloves + white lilies. Cold.

I wondered how the rich shopped and a very rich looking young woman rushed by reeking to high heavens with this scent. It doesn't smell like what they say is in it.

        "All reviews": "Show all reviewsIf someone stuck a gun to my head and told me \"You MUST wear a fragrance your store sells.\", then Eternity would be it. Eternity is a sort of watery floral and while it does have a kind of \"functional\" household fragrance vibe to it (a detergent or liquid dish/hand soap thing) it is the only scent in our \"designer fragrances\" counter that doesn't make me recoil in horror. Yeah, it is made of nothing but cheap aromachemicals so naturally it does smell cheap (to my refined nose anyhow) but I suspect most people would find it pleasant and inoffensive. You could spend a lot more to smell a lot worse. Just try to get a bottle on sale, shouldn't be too hard. Performance-wise it is on the level of an eau de cologne. Not a bad scent if your expectations aren't very high. 23rd March 2023270898Brian BuchananShow all reviewsIf we believe the backstory that Calvin Klein gave a ring to his wife inscribed Eternity, and this inspired the perfume, then it’s safe to assume that la Grojsman was given the brief ‘Do one of your Hug Me thingies, and make it last forever’ (or something to that effect). She did that alright, but what Eternity gives in longevity it takes away in legibility.It feels like her soft rose-violet formula has been stretched out, becoming longer and narrower, and all the details squeezed together. There's also an aquatic feel that makes it more streamlined, but it doesn’t do much for the quality of the rose.This was Grojsman’s sixth perfume and her first unpopular one on Basenotes. It gets 42% negative reviews (and 36% positive) and with certain exceptions, her ratings tend to go down from here on in.If you want to smell the work of Sophia Grojsman (and I urge you to do it) there are better places to start, Paris being the obvious one (the perfume not the city) and once you’ve smelled a couple of the Hug Me scents you’ll realise there’s not that much between them.Early on, I get an ashy note from the vintage parfum (which is full and in a pristine box, and made by Calvin Klein Cosmetics – not Coty) and in light of the fact that it doesn’t say anything new, except for a slight aquatic that's a wee bit scratchy, I'd say forget this and try some of the other early period works.9th June 2022275819ADVERTISEMENTrbakerShow all reviewsThe opening note includes a mandarin part - giving lightness and freshness- and white florals - mainly muguet. This all is combined with a whiff of a green herbal element. Bright and pleasant. Later on I get an ambery woodsiness that combines with a very soft and pale patchouli impression. I get soft sillage, adequate projection and four hours of longevity on my skin. A light daytime spring scent that starts in an agreeable fashion, but the drydown is very generic and not particularly enticing. 2.75/5. 6th February 2019212710Possum-PieShow all reviewsSophia Grojsman's classic fragrance, I can't tell if I love it b/c of its quality or b/c a girlfriend wore it 27 years ago. Maybe a bit of both. I love the crisp sharp citrus and the Grojsman artistry. One of my favorite women's fragrances. 18th July 2017188971jimmyfresnoShow all reviewsAn elderly woman came into the building I work in and I smelled this on her and had to ask her what it was. It is the most sheer fragrance but very powerful. Until I read the reviews here I loved it, but then I recognized each of the flaws spoken about: the soapiness, the cheap rose. But it's funny, I am quite a nose and didn't detect any of these before someone mentioned them. To me, it was a fresh white tulip or daffodil fragrance, so transparent and sparkling, but the only voice in the room at its high frequency. This could easily have slipped into the white musk Aquanet hairspray territory, but it didn't. I do notice these elegant, sheer florals that only charming older women can get away with for some reason. Girls don't smell like flowers anymore, they smell like really the popular aromachemical of the season. 23rd April 2017185692jaconaShow all reviewsI recall smelling this everywhere when I was a teen, people bathed it in. Back then as much as I loved it, I'd never have bought it because everyone else was wearing it. I recently bought a bottle after rediscovering a sample and still love this scent. Fresh, green floral, a hint of citrus and spice, a bit aquatic and ethereal. I can't comment on any of the flankers, but the original is beautiful. 16th February 2017182971daisyvisionShow all reviewsEternity has always reminded me of something a girl next door type would wear. Spicy carnation in a bouquet of lovely florals, a splash of citruses that help freshen up the green notes. Lily of the valley is bright and clean, and is a great complement to the soft and creamy carnation. Very pleasant - it's a great, clean '90s staple fragrance. 13th June 2016173110rskookydoughShow all reviewsMy husband surprised me with this for no reason. He probably found a good deal on ebay. My sister loved this when it first came out. I like it and I have received compliments. Its so floral and light I can go a little crazy when I spray it on. 28th May 2015157201Way Off ScenterShow all reviewsGenre: Floral OrientalEternity is a fruity rose scent that feels like Sophia Grojsman's attempt at a brighter, sweeter, and less complicated riff on the fruity-green rose chypre style she'd established with Calyx and Paris, and would explore further in Trésor, 100% Love, Yvresse, and Kashâya. While I'm not overly fond of any of Grojsman's essays on this theme, Eternity represents the weakest entry I have yet encountered.In this case, the whole concoction just feels cheap. The fruit accord is crude, harsh and artificial, without the plush lactonic accents that give scents like Yvresse and Kashâya their enveloping sense of indulgent luxury. What finally lets Eternity down though is the quality of its rose, which is too shrill, bitter, and soapy to tolerate over several hours of wear. I also find the rose excruciatingly loud, especially in the eau de parfum concentration. My takeaway impression is cheap, crude, and nasty.13th June 2014141729pallyShow all reviewsIt's good but doesn't last long and very subtle.. good for romantic wear for a young minded girl. It's not amazing but I like and the girls like they described it as Romantic, Flowerly, Manlyyeah I don't get how flowers and manly work together but those are what I've been told. There is better out there though and that's why I won't be purchasing it 9th April 2013126616bnusrShow all reviewsThe one and only perfume I truly can't stand. I had some house guests it must be about 20 years ago and one of them reeked of this. It smelled to me a mixture of arrogant and urinal-like. The 'arrogant' didn't come from the wearer who was a perfectly pleasant if somewhat overly conventional girl. I agree with Darvant about the gaminess, which coupled with the sharpness make it rank. I honestly can't even stay in the room with anyone wearing this, and the sillage must be unrivalled. I get it from a mile away.Overall impression; urine of a cyborg animal; indended for territorial marking. 31st January 2013123570DarvantShow all reviewsI don't particularly love this familiar and basically sharp fragrance that smells to me a bit dissonant, almost sweaty and synthetic. The mix is really floral with hints of green notes, citrus (mostly orange), some spices (a touch of cinnamon, cloves?), introducing a woody/musky base with just a touch of amber. The dry down is mostly sandalwood and musk under my nose. I detect some simil cherry synthetic fruity note in contrast with some green sharp element and the floral combination is deep and pungent. Penetrating floral notes (the lily effect is dominant to me together with the one from freesia), synthetic fruits, heady patchouli and a pronounced woody vibe are too powerful and unbalanced to me, producing a final dissonance. The final effect is too cloying, detergent kind and sweaty. 16th December 2012121276DebbiePope54Show all reviewsMy sister told me if you see a large number of a fragrance at TJ Max or similar clearance stores it means they're going to reformulate it or discontinue it. I saw a huge display of the original KL in the mid 80's at such a store, low & behold the scent was reformulated to something gross smelling. So when I recently saw a stack of (GASP!) Eternity bottles at TJ's I bought a couple. Yes, it's the real, original scent. Lots of light feminine notes, mostly light floral. But it can project a mile if used with a heavy hand! I hate to think this nice scent is most likely going to be changed. 4th October 2012120095yumcheesyShow all reviewsI won a bottle of this- it smells ok but when I sprayed it, it was like bug spray and I couldn't wash it off fast enough! It's super strong and kind of like a floor cleaner, maybe? Yuck. 10th August 2012114876BLAQShow all reviews3.4 oz. Gifted.I received Eternity as my very first fragrance a long time ago. Being my first bottle, I have never thrown it away.. However, I have not worn it in years either. It simply does not smell good to me.The sage notes alone, stand out, amidst the alcoholic mess. I sprayed some an hour ago to write this review and I hate it today as much as I did years ago. 2nd July 2012113036sofababeShow all reviewsEternity is an instantly recognisable scent, its unique, nothing else smells like it. I love it. I'm struggling to describe the fragrance tho, so difficult to pick out individual notes but I think for me I get carnation and narcissus, some spicy notes too. I would describe it overall as a cool, clean fragrance, not overly floral. 19th March 2012106916RiveGaucheInsteadShow all reviewsI used to wear this when I was a teenager. It has a bit of a sharp smell from what I recall and barely feminine imho. I wouldn't touch it with a 10 ft pole now. 6th March 2012106168DemeterShow all reviewsLooking over the fragrance notes, I have to laugh because my nose cannot isolate any of the listed scents. Clean, vaguely floral, but requires a delicate hand in application - it can be overwhelmingly strong. At times, this scent clashes with my body chemistry and smells almost spoiled, but gratefully, that doesn't often happen. 26th September 201198072miss millsShow all reviewsThere see to be many negative reviews of this perfume - for me, this fragrance suits my body chemistry beautifully and smells light and spicy on me. I wouldn't use more than 2 sprays, however or it could be too much. Not my favourite or signature but definitely would have a welcome place in my wardrobe anytime! 2nd July 201193755blood-orangeShow all reviewsI couldn't get over how sweet this fragrance was when I first applied it to my skin. I had expected something crisp and fresh, however what I got was something entirely different, very flowery and green.Eternity is rather soft and musky, yet quite classic and somewhat formal. In my personal opinion, I'd find this scent a little too strong for casual wear.I applaud Calvin Klein for creating a scent that would have easily re-defined fragrances in the 80's. Compared to the other scents from this decade, Eternity would have been a breath of fresh air. However, I must add that back then, and even today, Eternity is not a fragrance that will appeal to everyone.I particularly like the drydown which consists of a soft, flowery, clean skin-scent which really compliments my skin chemistry. My only criticism was that I found Eternity to smell rather similar to laundry detergent. It had that all too familiar crisp, clean, white shirt scent that for me seems a little bit predictable and common 4th June 201192301msleslieShow all reviewsI purposely avoided Calvin Klein fragrances for decades due to the suggestive ads, but now I have smelled them as part of my learning more about perfume. So I have come late to them all, and am happy to make their acquaintance. This fragrance is by Sophia Grojsman, my favorite perfumer, and in Eternity I can smell relatedness to YSL Paris, Vanderbilt, and Sun Moon Stars, each of which I like somewhat better than this one. LT in The Perfume Guide describes Eternity as 'loud rose' and 'screechy and soapy', but I guess I must enjoy those attributes! 3rd January 201181882sean-dtShow all reviewsI recognise this, as I've smelled it a thousand times before but I never really noticed it. That says it all really. It's quite nice, but so what? 28th December 201081526Weimar27Show all reviewsCalvin Klein's Eternity is the coolyreserved younger Sister to Obsessionbut neverless a simply Elegant MonocromeShaped Bottle the best bottle design in my collection in my opinion. but the scent is a mixure of menthol& powder. which is not my favoriteperfume but not the worst and i think it smell to synthentic. to be my Favorite. 9th October 201078777BetsyMeszarosShow all reviewsI've noticed that many don't like this. I also saw on a discussion group that many spray 5 or 6 sprays of a fragrance. I can't imagine doing this but with the light fruity single note fragrances issued today that may be necessary. Eternity only requires a couple of sprays - 3 at the most. I hasn't worn this in about 10 years and got it out today. It is very nice. It is warm yet light. This will never be my go to fragrance but I do like it and now that I have rediscovered it will probably be using it more often. 29th September 201079062123 Next Most reviews in the last weekColbourne (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (4)landshark321 (3)exmin (3)speedracer (3)RoamingRose (3)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)sakecat (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (28)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (8)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Lian (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

Eventually, the spices fade, the tobacco steps back and I'm left with a milk chocolate bar with a hint of pipe tobacco. If I needed to paint a scene - it would be the office of a tenured liberal arts professor who likes his pipes and Hershey's Kisses and likes the pretty co-eds in his classes even more.Filosofia is beautifully blended, yet legible. Sweet, but not cloying. Avoids being a literal cigar shop or a smoke bomb.

Eventually, the spices fade, the tobacco steps back and I'm left with a milk chocolate bar with a hint of pipe tobacco. If I needed to paint a scene - it would be the office of a tenured liberal arts professor who likes his pipes and Hershey's Kisses and likes the pretty co-eds in his classes even more.Filosofia is beautifully blended, yet legible. Sweet, but not cloying. Avoids being a literal cigar shop or a smoke bomb.

Not modern even for the time when it was launched at 2001. Fresh, aromatic in an atypical, nonaquatic way.Citrusy, aromatic and very sympathic. Relaxing and mature at the same time. For the summer heat and laziness in a spacey summer villa near the sea.Brings about positive emotions, quite elating!Originality 6/10Scent 7/10Longevity 8/10Projection 6/10___________________67,5% 27th July 2019219305Kaizen1972Show all reviewsVery fresh, bright fragrance from Christian Dior. Starts out with a noticeable burst of basil (great in cooking and colognes, cool ;^>) accented with spiciness including rosemary. Citrus opening notes last for an instant, mostly disappearing after drydown.Remnant is a stable cypress, along with a small aquatic tang with a slight kiss of musk.Reminiscent of 360 Degrees Red by Perry Ellis (though not as intense)and a very toned down Ralph Lauren Purple Label.Higher seems more suited for younger wearers in warmer weather. For me (being in my 40's), I can see myself wearing this for casual occasions, or for wearing around the house. 5th January 2017181118ADVERTISEMENTsilentrichShow all reviewsDior Higher is a modern floral that adds uncommon notes of pear wood and cypress that makes it unique. Higher is really the perfect name for this fragrance because it's a very uplifting etheral type of fragrance. Fantastic for summer and I could also see this being worn in the spring. Higher is subtle in projection, but has a presence. This can easiliy be a unisex fragrance because of the floral elements. If I had to sum up what Higher is I would say that it's Dior Homme's little brother. I don't love Higher, but I think it's unique enough to own a bottle of and pleasant enough to wear on a regular basis. 6th November 2013128386blackenedShow all reviewsHigher by Dior? I like it , energetic opening tending to lemon and pear with a touch of sexy spices , in the middle phase becomes an elegant and charming floral :unmistakable signature of Dior house.It has a certain air to eau de rochas man but the one from Dior is more floral in its stele.It´s a pity its poor longevity because immediately stay close to skin.If only it would project more... 27th October 2010101150colormechrisShow all reviewsLet's face it. The French are the masters of perfume. Nine times out of ten, you pick up a bottle where the juice has impressed you enough to try to read that teeny-tiny printing and it says: Made In France. It's in their blood. Like pizza, French perfume seems to ascribe to the adage: \"Even when it's bad, it's pretty good\". Such is the case with Dior Higher. Clearly this is being pitched to a younger demographic with the high-tech package and the \"fresh\" juice within. And certainly better things have come out of France and the House of Dior (a whole bunch of true classics). Higher is never going to be placed on a pedastal next to say, Eau Sauvage or Diorissimo; and by Dior's standards it definitely falls on the lower end of their QC scale...But, all in all, it's not bad. A spicy/fresh no-nonsense affair that you can just squirt and go without having to think about it. Pear is not the first note you might think of wearing, but who doesn't like the smell of pears? Doesn't have the greatest projection or sillage. Seems this would do best in the Summer months. And you can just toss the decanter into a briefcase or whatever...it's all ready \"travel style\". 12th May 201030033BigslyShow all reviewsThe pyramid looks accurate, but the spices are mild. This is natural smelling, and has decent projection/\"sillage\" and longevity for me. The musk is mild, and it is well balanced. This is not what I usually look for in a fragrance, and I obtained it as part of a lot purchase, but I now enjoy it as a \"change of pace.\" I think of it as a dry, herbal, woody with a touch of pear. One reviewer compared this to Tommy, but I find that one to be a bit too strong and simple now. Higher has nice dynamism to it, so that it's hard to pin down what's going on, and my guess is that some people really don't like that, and prefer the more straightforward approach. I can't speak to top notes because I try to avoid them, but once they are mostly gone, this is rather linear and you either like what remains or you don't. I doubt I would ever buy a bottle, because it is a bit too expensive for my budget, but I can see how some really like it. There may be better fragrances of this type, but because I haven't sampled many I can only base my review on a few (assuming that you too think that Tommy should be compared to this one). Because I like the dynamism and balance, and because I like it once in a while, I'll give it a positive, though I would agree that it's not \"special.\" 26th January 201050976vdxxlShow all reviewsNice for a fresh cologne. It smells refined, it really suits urban fashion. Great for a night in town. Great for students. It is fresh, but not generic, it is natural smelling, which you cannot find in fresh fragrances( Ozone Mist, Sea Scents- all of these are synthetic). Go ahead if you hate aquatics, but love fresh-chypre cologne. 30th March 200930113PigeonMurdererShow all reviewsInteresting to see all the complaints about the lasting power. Oddly this scent lasts on me fairly well; I have no complaints.And I kind of like the juice in itself, too. I keep thinking I probably shouldn't just because it's not my usual style, but damn, this is one enjoyable scent.Very happy and playful fresh juicy fruit notes. It turns more towards woods and musk in the drydown.Well balanced refreshing juice. Nothing spectacular, it's a little scent after all, but it is worth to try and let me say I have experienced admiration towards this one from some females too. And that has been a real rare treat for me, unfortunately. 15th February 200917202Kabamaru ninjaShow all reviewsI was waiting not to like it,but I was wrong!Its a spicy dry fresh sweet long lasting scent.Also its strong enough to satisfy me,not like its \"cousin\" Higher Energythat smells different (clean and better) but is very weak in compere to this. Higher is Dior's spicy and a little sporty\"child\".Unique scent! 3rd October 200861327rodentShow all reviewsThis is one ingredient list that actually looks accurate; the opening notes are almost all citrus, pear and basil. The combination of the latter two is astonishingly inventive -- it's very slightly sweet without being sweet in a gourmand sense, and pungent without being spicy in the conventional sense -- and really works. The scent goes through a fairly synthetic-smelling fresh phase before it winds down into its somewhat musky drydown -- which, incidentally, isn't terribly complex or exciting. But having said all this -- Higher really works. It comes across as a modern, fresh scent that fits squarely into the aquatic / fresh paradigm of the late 90s -- yet manages to smell quite different from anything else out there due to the pear and basil combo. Sillage is really excellent as it's quite a sharp juice. Great one for a 35 and under crowd -- a bit frisky for everyone else, but wearable. 23rd September 200842905jensonShow all reviewsWell, not a single review here comes remotely close to describing how this scent actually smells. I am really surprised by all the negative and neutral reviews on this one. Lame, that I am explaining how a scent smells but ill give it a shot considering this one is a scent that I like him a lot. This is clearly a scent in disguise, by this I mean, it's heart which forms the woody notes actually spreads it tentacles to top notes almost immediately on application with underlying musk notes giving it a satin smooth powdery effect. The pear note emerges into forefront with a silver lining along with gentle citrus notes. The citrus is not done in an L'eau D'Issey or a CK one way...it very beautifully plays a supporting role to the entire progression. This one is very powdery and settles down to a very musky, woody note. just like SMW, there is a signature note in this one, maybe the pear. It adds character to this scent. 7-8 sprays last very long. a big thumbs up coz its different and not run of the mill types. 23rd September 200844702madridbatabiddShow all reviewsIt smell quite unique to me nice mix of citrus with the watery prominent pear note 24th June 200728711scenteur7Show all reviewsI'm holding onto this one, unusual from start to finish - pear, musk and rosemary in an equally unusual bottle. I love the fresh fruit notes set against the greens and woods. Absolutely unique. 15th January 200620213takemyhusbandplzShow all reviewsA guy I used to date wore this cologne and I still LOVE the smell of a man wearing this. Something about the basil and cypress together...smells so hot. It may not be complex, but believe me your woman will eat you up with this on! 29th November 200521875BrothaGShow all reviewsAlthough it's not very complex or extreme, this fragrance is heaven for summer. It reminds me of a hot day in spring on a wonderful island. I like how this fragrance has a very nice balance between floral and spicy - it's sweet, yet with a spicy, heavy base. Lasts long, even on hot days. 24th October 20051870JTYGShow all reviewsBasil top note young and heap... but lack complexcity... suitable for a hot day. My Boyfriend LOVES IT ;) 21st November 200412103JimInCOShow all reviewsThe initial scent is that of many--citrus and fruit. Yet the dry-down is the magic. I mean it is terrific and tone downed musk and woody tones. I love it! One of my top ten even though the monolithic form of the decanter is odd. 9th September 200311243AlexShow all reviewsThis is a fresh, clean, confortable fragance.One of my favorites. 1st April 2003819DJBadgerShow all reviewsI first smelled Higher in a magazine advertisement a while back and recently invested in it. This fragrance isn't for everybody, but in my opinion, it's fantastic. It exudes a sweet and brilliant aroma of citrus, along with a considerable hint of spice. The scent stays on my skin for quite a while, though I still feel compelled to spray more on because it smells so great. The aura it creates is strong, playful, and - though this may sound strange - \"smart.\" The packaging is quite unusual and definitely stands out; the metallic housing is topped with a layer of rubber, the center of which hides the trigger for the fragrance. It's a very creative package matched with a genuinely wonderful scent, good enough earn me a few compliments. Higher has quickly climbed up towards the top of my favourite fragrances.

Delicate and flowery and almost too feminine to my nose now. I bought this in my twenties and it fell out of use. Not offensive since its subtle but I found since its so light it is easy to over do-it, the projection is rather good. I regifted the cologne but kept the bar soap, which is a nice change up for business suits and the like, when wearing cologne would not be appropriate. 29th February 2012105842Mario JustinianiShow all reviewsA fruity three star scent which according to 'The Basenotes Says' info is:\"The latest male launch from Dior, 4 years on from Dune for Men. Desgned (sic) for the youth market, ( My guess is 15 year olds--or former users Aqua di Gio which really amounts to the same thing ) this is very fresh ( What! The young are buying fresh scents at the mall? Stop the presses!)and has an eye catching bottle.\"Still, I'd like to give it a thumbs up for ebullience ( um--did I spell that right?) it reminds me of Clinique Happy, Quasar and Paco's XS, only with pears. I'd like to but . . .28th April 200988938lu'luShow all reviewsBoth Dior Higher and Higher Energy has a weak longevity, it stays on skin for about 10 to 15 minutes then with an open arms, it allows your body odor to take over. However, speaking of fragrance accord, Higher offers a pleasant, light citrus opening, very refined and subtle, later on the fragrance evolves to something which is herbal fresh, spicy and woody. Yet, the herbal freshness is not like any other 'green' fragrance, its progress is beautifully controlled as it surface. The bottle is beautifully made, simple yet truly an eye-catcher. IMO, the fragrance accord is wonderfully made, but considering that Higher is from Dior, a fragrance powerhouse, its weak longevity is totally unforgiven. 5th November 200862571distortechShow all reviewsI like this scent in its own way, but not as well as other Dior offerings. I do like the basenotes alot (while they last). Something about the base is different than others in this category that I find charming and worthy of the moniker. However, problem is, it's ONLY just a tad better than the others and then as quickly as the base comes out . . . it's over. Nonetheless, nice while it lasts AND it's Dior. As such, it stands in a lofty \"HIGHER,\" if you will, place in my collection. Viva Dior! 18th October 200741808AndrewthecologneguyShow all reviewsThis is nice but not great. Not strong enough. it is in the vein of Fahrenheit 32 to my nose, though 32 is much much deeper and stronger. Only buy this if you like Dior in general or just like collecting frags. Otherwise, there is no point. 18th June 200733798nolinShow all reviewsthis one smells nice when it comes out of the bottle. not so nice, though, after it's been on your skin for a few hours: very synthetic. well, it's synthetic if you can smell it at all: it doesn't last. 21st May 200741046syidi_radziShow all reviews80% love the bottle20% love the fragrancenot really long-lasting 6th May 200621558smelly..Show all reviewsagain rather like armani's mania its a \"nice\" fragrance which is pleasant enough for regualr daywera but nothing extraordinary..at least not for myself..still it has a light top note which is easy on the nose but lasts a pathetically short time..\"nice\" 21st March 200620890LiveJazzShow all reviewsI love the bottle, but the notes are average at best.

There is a very nice pear note that I rather enjoy. It's sweet, but not so sweet that it disrupts the refreshing feeling of the fragrance. The biggest downside to this fragrance is the fact that it lasts for around an hour on me. After about 30 minutes it wears too close to the skin for me to enjoy, and in 30 more minutes, it's gone. 20th September 200510212Most reviews in the last weekColbourne (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (4)landshark321 (3)exmin (3)speedracer (3)RoamingRose (3)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)sakecat (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (28)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (8)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Lian (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

If they were going for a weak bland scent with no longevity they did a great job. I don't believe this is anything more than cologne strength. This lasts no more than 2 hours with no projection. The quality just isn't there considering the price it's being sold for. Plenty of other quality scents at this price point that would be way more enjoyable. 8th June 2016172903ADVERTISEMENTWay Off ScenterShow all reviewsGenre: FougèreI have certain expectations of the house that launched Diorella, Diorissimo, Eau Sauvage, Fahrenheit, and Dune. Higher meets none of them. The only way I can explain badness as profound as this coming from Dior is as a cynical attempt to cash in on the fresh, aquatic masculine sports fragrance trend with the absolute minimum of effort or expenditure.Never mind the scent pyramid. I smell only three ingredients in Higher: Calone (fruity aquatic), an abrasive woody amber, and a clean musk that smells just like laundry detergent (only not as good).Just nasty.15th June 2014141988rbakerShow all reviewsThe opening is nice and fresh with a touch of fruitylemon, but in the drydown with touches of wood, a nonspecific floweriness and a bit of wood that merges with a smidgeon of a musky notes it remains a bit insipid on my skin. Projection is poor, and a longevity of less than two hours in this type of scent is not satisfactory. 5th January 2013122257DarvantShow all reviewsBare as a street of the Kiev's perifery, sadly lemony, angular, colourless and dry. The beginning is nothing than  tasteless and artificial greens, synthetic fruity-ozonic chord and lemon. In a so dry fragrance the link of green apple, basil and lemon is overly astringent and almost acid. I don't see any trace of montaneous aroma in the wake despite the presence of rosemary and cypress.  The higher balsamic wake of Blenheim Bouquet is so far over the moon. The spices are nothing than pepper under my nose, anyway are dry, sugarless and stuck. I don't detect ambergris in the dry down ( it's the pepper that  imprints masculine final dustiness i suppose) but just a laundry musk and some neutral woods unable to colour this onedimentional aquatic. Anonymous as whatever Zegna or Boss out there. 10th October 201198899warlandsboyShow all reviewsDamn the opening to this one is RAUNCHY! Peeee-ewwwww! LMAO Thankfully its died down within a matter of minutes. I'm getting a picture in my head of mold...fresh, wet, stinky mold with a definite sharpness to it. I could definitely see spraying this on someone as some sort of practical joke...or perhaps the joke is on me? 4th September 200972325foetidusShow all reviewsI do not like the opening. To my nose it has a very off note that smells like something like moldy varnish. I think the moldy varnish is a really distorted rosemary / pepper / cold spice accord that is the cause of this annoyance: Higher has a poorly executed use of spices, in my opinion. I think the cypress is in there, but it comes through muddled in with the spice accord. The base is primarily wood: An uninspired wood that has a hard time vying with the annoying spice accord that seems to have way too much longevity. Frankly, I don't like this one at all. 23rd August 20086680SirSlartyShow all reviewsPepper. Like maybe a crumb of it. In water.

(Perhaps Michael by Michael Kors, but at least his scent confused me for awhile before it's true colors shone)I just sprayed one shot of this stuff to my neck 10 min ago. For 10 min, I was gagging on what smelled like \"pepper\". TONS of pepper. I came here to see what is in this stuff (as I have a sample), and discovered \"spicy notes\" and \"basil\".Maybe that's what I'm smelling, but combined, it smells like PEPPER.And as a few have noted, it does not last. (Thankfully) 10min later, and I really can't smell it anymore.Man, I smell like SEASONINGS!~Journey 13th December 200745140noutShow all reviewsEdit 13th May, 2018What was I thinking. Hate the smell, got rid of it many years ago.I smoked cigarettes back then and ever since I quit smoking my nose got more sensitive day by day.

My previous review:This was the first fragrance I bought after 5 years or so living without any.Before that I was satisfied with Caractere and Boss Elements, but Caractere was discontinued and Elements nowhere to be found.I had my mind pretty much set on Paco Rabane's XS of which I had a miniature.**at the time I found it more fun to collect miniatures, for the bottle itself rather than the scent which I felt were awful most of the time (Armani, Polo, Boss, Drakar Noir...bleh!) but XS was one of the few I liked**At the shop I tried different EDTs including XS, all were too sweet for my taste.Higher was the only fragrance which reminded me of Caractere and Boss ElementsThose EDTs were a bit darker and less cloying than the usual loud popular ones.The only thing I didn't like about those fragrances was the poor sillage and lack of some sharpness.I don't mean sharpness in the sense of nose-aching sweetness or a heavy citrus blast, but more a pointy sensation, some texture at the heart of the scent, which both Caracter and Boss Elements lacked.Higher, being a more modern fragrance and probably more synthetic than Caracter and Elements did have that bite, (ozonic perhaps?) which pretty much seems to mark or direct the scent instead of remaining vaguely atmospheric.The sillage seemed much better too.The dry-down of this one is really nice on my skinDark, woodsy, mossy and, similar to Caractere and Elements, but with a note of citrus added.So yes you could say it turns a bit sour on the skin, but in a very natural citrussy and pleasant way.I like it better than XS's, less sweet and warmer.But the sillage is still too narrow, a private affair, no one except me seems to smell it.Unlike most I don't like the bottle that much, I much prefer old fashiond, straight glass bottles 18th May 2007201454tvlampboyShow all reviewsShould have been christened \"Lower.\"Can't imagine why anybody would get excite over this citrus snoozer. No lasting power, either (and that's a good thing). 5th October 200629316MonkeyManMattShow all reviewsSuperb \"post-modern\" bottle, boring \"modern\" fragrance. I have a personal grudge with pear as a note and Burberry London is the only blend (I can think of now) that makes it tolerable. Cerruti Image, Perry Ellis Portfolio and yes, Dior's Higher are all ruined by this strange, edgy fruit-note. The overall is impression is a sharp one, not very balanced. Higher smells almost acidic, very sour at least. Good sillage for a post 2000 release, but it doesn't help unfortunately as the juice leaves so much to be desired. 15th September 200514932scentimusShow all reviewsThe scent smells like a light carbon copy of Tommy. It is a very light scent but last a while. I am so surprised at Dior, Farhenhiet was so cutting edge at it time yet this Higher is just like everything else and more geared toward a 18 to 24 crowd.

Not modern even for the time when it was launched at 2001. Fresh, aromatic in an atypical, nonaquatic way.Citrusy, aromatic and very sympathic. Relaxing and mature at the same time.

Starts out with a noticeable burst of basil (great in cooking and colognes, cool ;^>) accented with spiciness including rosemary. Citrus opening notes last for an instant, mostly disappearing after drydown.Remnant is a stable cypress, along with a small aquatic tang with a slight kiss of musk.Reminiscent of 360 Degrees Red by Perry Ellis (though not as intense)and a very toned down Ralph Lauren Purple Label.Higher seems more suited for younger wearers in warmer weather. For me (being in my 40's), I can see myself wearing this for casual occasions, or for wearing around the house. 5th January 2017181118ADVERTISEMENTsilentrichShow all reviewsDior Higher is a modern floral that adds uncommon notes of pear wood and cypress that makes it unique. Higher is really the perfect name for this fragrance because it's a very uplifting etheral type of fragrance. Fantastic for summer and I could also see this being worn in the spring. Higher is subtle in projection, but has a presence. This can easiliy be a unisex fragrance because of the floral elements. If I had to sum up what Higher is I would say that it's Dior Homme's little brother. I don't love Higher, but I think it's unique enough to own a bottle of and pleasant enough to wear on a regular basis. 6th November 2013128386blackenedShow all reviewsHigher by Dior? I like it , energetic opening tending to lemon and pear with a touch of sexy spices , in the middle phase becomes an elegant and charming floral :unmistakable signature of Dior house.It has a certain air to eau de rochas man but the one from Dior is more floral in its stele.It´s a pity its poor longevity because immediately stay close to skin.If only it would project more... 27th October 2010101150colormechrisShow all reviewsLet's face it. The French are the masters of perfume. Nine times out of ten, you pick up a bottle where the juice has impressed you enough to try to read that teeny-tiny printing and it says: Made In France. It's in their blood. Like pizza, French perfume seems to ascribe to the adage: \"Even when it's bad, it's pretty good\". Such is the case with Dior Higher. Clearly this is being pitched to a younger demographic with the high-tech package and the \"fresh\" juice within. And certainly better things have come out of France and the House of Dior (a whole bunch of true classics). Higher is never going to be placed on a pedastal next to say, Eau Sauvage or Diorissimo; and by Dior's standards it definitely falls on the lower end of their QC scale...But, all in all, it's not bad. A spicy/fresh no-nonsense affair that you can just squirt and go without having to think about it. Pear is not the first note you might think of wearing, but who doesn't like the smell of pears? Doesn't have the greatest projection or sillage. Seems this would do best in the Summer months. And you can just toss the decanter into a briefcase or whatever...it's all ready \"travel style\". 12th May 201030033BigslyShow all reviewsThe pyramid looks accurate, but the spices are mild. This is natural smelling, and has decent projection/\"sillage\" and longevity for me. The musk is mild, and it is well balanced. This is not what I usually look for in a fragrance, and I obtained it as part of a lot purchase, but I now enjoy it as a \"change of pace.\" I think of it as a dry, herbal, woody with a touch of pear. One reviewer compared this to Tommy, but I find that one to be a bit too strong and simple now. Higher has nice dynamism to it, so that it's hard to pin down what's going on, and my guess is that some people really don't like that, and prefer the more straightforward approach. I can't speak to top notes because I try to avoid them, but once they are mostly gone, this is rather linear and you either like what remains or you don't. I doubt I would ever buy a bottle, because it is a bit too expensive for my budget, but I can see how some really like it. There may be better fragrances of this type, but because I haven't sampled many I can only base my review on a few (assuming that you too think that Tommy should be compared to this one). Because I like the dynamism and balance, and because I like it once in a while, I'll give it a positive, though I would agree that it's not \"special.\" 26th January 201050976vdxxlShow all reviewsNice for a fresh cologne. It smells refined, it really suits urban fashion. Great for a night in town. Great for students. It is fresh, but not generic, it is natural smelling, which you cannot find in fresh fragrances( Ozone Mist, Sea Scents- all of these are synthetic). Go ahead if you hate aquatics, but love fresh-chypre cologne. 30th March 200930113PigeonMurdererShow all reviewsInteresting to see all the complaints about the lasting power. Oddly this scent lasts on me fairly well; I have no complaints.And I kind of like the juice in itself, too. I keep thinking I probably shouldn't just because it's not my usual style, but damn, this is one enjoyable scent.Very happy and playful fresh juicy fruit notes. It turns more towards woods and musk in the drydown.Well balanced refreshing juice. Nothing spectacular, it's a little scent after all, but it is worth to try and let me say I have experienced admiration towards this one from some females too. And that has been a real rare treat for me, unfortunately. 15th February 200917202Kabamaru ninjaShow all reviewsI was waiting not to like it,but I was wrong!Its a spicy dry fresh sweet long lasting scent.Also its strong enough to satisfy me,not like its \"cousin\" Higher Energythat smells different (clean and better) but is very weak in compere to this. Higher is Dior's spicy and a little sporty\"child\".Unique scent! 3rd October 200861327rodentShow all reviewsThis is one ingredient list that actually looks accurate; the opening notes are almost all citrus, pear and basil. The combination of the latter two is astonishingly inventive -- it's very slightly sweet without being sweet in a gourmand sense, and pungent without being spicy in the conventional sense -- and really works. The scent goes through a fairly synthetic-smelling fresh phase before it winds down into its somewhat musky drydown -- which, incidentally, isn't terribly complex or exciting. But having said all this -- Higher really works. It comes across as a modern, fresh scent that fits squarely into the aquatic / fresh paradigm of the late 90s -- yet manages to smell quite different from anything else out there due to the pear and basil combo. Sillage is really excellent as it's quite a sharp juice. Great one for a 35 and under crowd -- a bit frisky for everyone else, but wearable. 23rd September 200842905jensonShow all reviewsWell, not a single review here comes remotely close to describing how this scent actually smells. I am really surprised by all the negative and neutral reviews on this one. Lame, that I am explaining how a scent smells but ill give it a shot considering this one is a scent that I like him a lot. This is clearly a scent in disguise, by this I mean, it's heart which forms the woody notes actually spreads it tentacles to top notes almost immediately on application with underlying musk notes giving it a satin smooth powdery effect. The pear note emerges into forefront with a silver lining along with gentle citrus notes. The citrus is not done in an L'eau D'Issey or a CK one way...it very beautifully plays a supporting role to the entire progression. This one is very powdery and settles down to a very musky, woody note. just like SMW, there is a signature note in this one, maybe the pear. It adds character to this scent. 7-8 sprays last very long. a big thumbs up coz its different and not run of the mill types. 23rd September 200844702madridbatabiddShow all reviewsIt smell quite unique to me nice mix of citrus with the watery prominent pear note 24th June 200728711scenteur7Show all reviewsI'm holding onto this one, unusual from start to finish - pear, musk and rosemary in an equally unusual bottle. I love the fresh fruit notes set against the greens and woods. Absolutely unique. 15th January 200620213takemyhusbandplzShow all reviewsA guy I used to date wore this cologne and I still LOVE the smell of a man wearing this. Something about the basil and cypress together...smells so hot. It may not be complex, but believe me your woman will eat you up with this on! 29th November 200521875BrothaGShow all reviewsAlthough it's not very complex or extreme, this fragrance is heaven for summer. It reminds me of a hot day in spring on a wonderful island. I like how this fragrance has a very nice balance between floral and spicy - it's sweet, yet with a spicy, heavy base. Lasts long, even on hot days. 24th October 20051870JTYGShow all reviewsBasil top note young and heap... but lack complexcity... suitable for a hot day. My Boyfriend LOVES IT ;) 21st November 200412103JimInCOShow all reviewsThe initial scent is that of many--citrus and fruit. Yet the dry-down is the magic. I mean it is terrific and tone downed musk and woody tones. I love it! One of my top ten even though the monolithic form of the decanter is odd. 9th September 200311243AlexShow all reviewsThis is a fresh, clean, confortable fragance.One of my favorites. 1st April 2003819DJBadgerShow all reviewsI first smelled Higher in a magazine advertisement a while back and recently invested in it. This fragrance isn't for everybody, but in my opinion, it's fantastic. It exudes a sweet and brilliant aroma of citrus, along with a considerable hint of spice. The scent stays on my skin for quite a while, though I still feel compelled to spray more on because it smells so great. The aura it creates is strong, playful, and - though this may sound strange - \"smart.\" The packaging is quite unusual and definitely stands out; the metallic housing is topped with a layer of rubber, the center of which hides the trigger for the fragrance. It's a very creative package matched with a genuinely wonderful scent, good enough earn me a few compliments. Higher has quickly climbed up towards the top of my favourite fragrances.

Delicate and flowery and almost too feminine to my nose now. I bought this in my twenties and it fell out of use. Not offensive since its subtle but I found since its so light it is easy to over do-it, the projection is rather good. I regifted the cologne but kept the bar soap, which is a nice change up for business suits and the like, when wearing cologne would not be appropriate. 29th February 2012105842Mario JustinianiShow all reviewsA fruity three star scent which according to 'The Basenotes Says' info is:\"The latest male launch from Dior, 4 years on from Dune for Men. Desgned (sic) for the youth market, ( My guess is 15 year olds--or former users Aqua di Gio which really amounts to the same thing ) this is very fresh ( What!

Stop the presses!)and has an eye catching bottle.\"Still, I'd like to give it a thumbs up for ebullience ( um--did I spell that right?) it reminds me of Clinique Happy, Quasar and Paco's XS, only with pears. I'd like to but . . .28th April 200988938lu'luShow all reviewsBoth Dior Higher and Higher Energy has a weak longevity, it stays on skin for about 10 to 15 minutes then with an open arms, it allows your body odor to take over. However, speaking of fragrance accord, Higher offers a pleasant, light citrus opening, very refined and subtle, later on the fragrance evolves to something which is herbal fresh, spicy and woody. Yet, the herbal freshness is not like any other 'green' fragrance, its progress is beautifully controlled as it surface. The bottle is beautifully made, simple yet truly an eye-catcher. IMO, the fragrance accord is wonderfully made, but considering that Higher is from Dior, a fragrance powerhouse, its weak longevity is totally unforgiven. 5th November 200862571distortechShow all reviewsI like this scent in its own way, but not as well as other Dior offerings. I do like the basenotes alot (while they last). Something about the base is different than others in this category that I find charming and worthy of the moniker. However, problem is, it's ONLY just a tad better than the others and then as quickly as the base comes out . . . it's over. Nonetheless, nice while it lasts AND it's Dior. As such, it stands in a lofty \"HIGHER,\" if you will, place in my collection. Viva Dior! 18th October 200741808AndrewthecologneguyShow all reviewsThis is nice but not great. Not strong enough. it is in the vein of Fahrenheit 32 to my nose, though 32 is much much deeper and stronger. Only buy this if you like Dior in general or just like collecting frags. Otherwise, there is no point. 18th June 200733798nolinShow all reviewsthis one smells nice when it comes out of the bottle. not so nice, though, after it's been on your skin for a few hours: very synthetic. well, it's synthetic if you can smell it at all: it doesn't last. 21st May 200741046syidi_radziShow all reviews80% love the bottle20% love the fragrancenot really long-lasting 6th May 200621558smelly..Show all reviewsagain rather like armani's mania its a \"nice\" fragrance which is pleasant enough for regualr daywera but nothing extraordinary..at least not for myself..still it has a light top note which is easy on the nose but lasts a pathetically short time..\"nice\" 21st March 200620890LiveJazzShow all reviewsI love the bottle, but the notes are average at best.

There is a very nice pear note that I rather enjoy. It's sweet, but not so sweet that it disrupts the refreshing feeling of the fragrance. The biggest downside to this fragrance is the fact that it lasts for around an hour on me. After about 30 minutes it wears too close to the skin for me to enjoy, and in 30 more minutes, it's gone. 20th September 200510212Most reviews in the last weekmanlyscents (8)Colbourne (8)Varanis Ridari (4)landshark321 (3)exmin (3)speedracer (3)RoamingRose (3)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)SPACEDOUT (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (28)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (8)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Lian (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

If they were going for a weak bland scent with no longevity they did a great job. I don't believe this is anything more than cologne strength. This lasts no more than 2 hours with no projection. The quality just isn't there considering the price it's being sold for. Plenty of other quality scents at this price point that would be way more enjoyable. 8th June 2016172903ADVERTISEMENTWay Off ScenterShow all reviewsGenre: FougèreI have certain expectations of the house that launched Diorella, Diorissimo, Eau Sauvage, Fahrenheit, and Dune. Higher meets none of them. The only way I can explain badness as profound as this coming from Dior is as a cynical attempt to cash in on the fresh, aquatic masculine sports fragrance trend with the absolute minimum of effort or expenditure.Never mind the scent pyramid. I smell only three ingredients in Higher: Calone (fruity aquatic), an abrasive woody amber, and a clean musk that smells just like laundry detergent (only not as good).Just nasty.15th June 2014141988rbakerShow all reviewsThe opening is nice and fresh with a touch of fruitylemon, but in the drydown with touches of wood, a nonspecific floweriness and a bit of wood that merges with a smidgeon of a musky notes it remains a bit insipid on my skin. Projection is poor, and a longevity of less than two hours in this type of scent is not satisfactory. 5th January 2013122257DarvantShow all reviewsBare as a street of the Kiev's perifery, sadly lemony, angular, colourless and dry. The beginning is nothing than  tasteless and artificial greens, synthetic fruity-ozonic chord and lemon. In a so dry fragrance the link of green apple, basil and lemon is overly astringent and almost acid. I don't see any trace of montaneous aroma in the wake despite the presence of rosemary and cypress.  The higher balsamic wake of Blenheim Bouquet is so far over the moon. The spices are nothing than pepper under my nose, anyway are dry, sugarless and stuck. I don't detect ambergris in the dry down ( it's the pepper that  imprints masculine final dustiness i suppose) but just a laundry musk and some neutral woods unable to colour this onedimentional aquatic. Anonymous as whatever Zegna or Boss out there. 10th October 201198899warlandsboyShow all reviewsDamn the opening to this one is RAUNCHY! Peeee-ewwwww! LMAO Thankfully its died down within a matter of minutes. I'm getting a picture in my head of mold...fresh, wet, stinky mold with a definite sharpness to it. I could definitely see spraying this on someone as some sort of practical joke...or perhaps the joke is on me? 4th September 200972325foetidusShow all reviewsI do not like the opening. To my nose it has a very off note that smells like something like moldy varnish. I think the moldy varnish is a really distorted rosemary / pepper / cold spice accord that is the cause of this annoyance: Higher has a poorly executed use of spices, in my opinion. I think the cypress is in there, but it comes through muddled in with the spice accord. The base is primarily wood: An uninspired wood that has a hard time vying with the annoying spice accord that seems to have way too much longevity. Frankly, I don't like this one at all. 23rd August 20086680SirSlartyShow all reviewsPepper. Like maybe a crumb of it. In water. This is so dilute that I think the name refers to the meniscus of the alcohol in the test tube they used to make the scent the scent. 11th July 200847848JourneyShow all reviewsI'm a young 27 year old and I have one thing to say about this \"fragrance\" that is marketed to 20-somethings.ECK!I've never smelled something so foul! (Perhaps Michael by Michael Kors, but at least his scent confused me for awhile before it's true colors shone)I just sprayed one shot of this stuff to my neck 10 min ago. For 10 min, I was gagging on what smelled like \"pepper\". TONS of pepper. I came here to see what is in this stuff (as I have a sample), and discovered \"spicy notes\" and \"basil\".Maybe that's what I'm smelling, but combined, it smells like PEPPER.And as a few have noted, it does not last. (Thankfully) 10min later, and I really can't smell it anymore.Man, I smell like SEASONINGS!~Journey 13th December 200745140noutShow all reviewsEdit 13th May, 2018What was I thinking. Hate the smell, got rid of it many years ago.I smoked cigarettes back then and ever since I quit smoking my nose got more sensitive day by day. This fragrance smells like it wants to cover up body odour while failing. My previous review:This was the first fragrance I bought after 5 years or so living without any.Before that I was satisfied with Caractere and Boss Elements, but Caractere was discontinued and Elements nowhere to be found.I had my mind pretty much set on Paco Rabane's XS of which I had a miniature.**at the time I found it more fun to collect miniatures, for the bottle itself rather than the scent which I felt were awful most of the time (Armani, Polo, Boss, Drakar Noir...bleh!) but XS was one of the few I liked**At the shop I tried different EDTs including XS, all were too sweet for my taste.Higher was the only fragrance which reminded me of Caractere and Boss ElementsThose EDTs were a bit darker and less cloying than the usual loud popular ones.The only thing I didn't like about those fragrances was the poor sillage and lack of some sharpness.I don't mean sharpness in the sense of nose-aching sweetness or a heavy citrus blast, but more a pointy sensation, some texture at the heart of the scent, which both Caracter and Boss Elements lacked.Higher, being a more modern fragrance and probably more synthetic than Caracter and Elements did have that bite, (ozonic perhaps?) which pretty much seems to mark or direct the scent instead of remaining vaguely atmospheric.The sillage seemed much better too.The dry-down of this one is really nice on my skinDark, woodsy, mossy and, similar to Caractere and Elements, but with a note of citrus added.So yes you could say it turns a bit sour on the skin, but in a very natural citrussy and pleasant way.I like it better than XS's, less sweet and warmer.But the sillage is still too narrow, a private affair, no one except me seems to smell it.Unlike most I don't like the bottle that much, I much prefer old fashiond, straight glass bottles 18th May 2007201454tvlampboyShow all reviewsShould have been christened \"Lower.\"Can't imagine why anybody would get excite over this citrus snoozer. No lasting power, either (and that's a good thing). 5th October 200629316MonkeyManMattShow all reviewsSuperb \"post-modern\" bottle, boring \"modern\" fragrance. I have a personal grudge with pear as a note and Burberry London is the only blend (I can think of now) that makes it tolerable. Cerruti Image, Perry Ellis Portfolio and yes, Dior's Higher are all ruined by this strange, edgy fruit-note. The overall is impression is a sharp one, not very balanced. Higher smells almost acidic, very sour at least. Good sillage for a post 2000 release, but it doesn't help unfortunately as the juice leaves so much to be desired. 15th September 200514932scentimusShow all reviewsThe scent smells like a light carbon copy of Tommy. It is a very light scent but last a while. I am so surprised at Dior, Farhenhiet was so cutting edge at it time yet this Higher is just like everything else and more geared toward a 18 to 24 crowd.

        "All reviews": "Show all reviewsPossibly the worse fragrance I have ever smelled. Flash floor cleaner and pencil shavings.A scrubber, (that requires several scrubs to eliminate). 1st March 2022255101ZgbShow all reviewsEn par with Pasha de Cartier, well that style at least. Not modern even for the time when it was launched at 2001. Fresh, aromatic in an atypical, nonaquatic way.Citrusy, aromatic and very sympathic. Relaxing and mature at the same time. For the summer heat and laziness in a spacey summer villa near the sea.Brings about positive emotions, quite elating!Originality 6/10Scent 7/10Longevity 8/10Projection 6/10___________________67,5% 27th July 2019219305ADVERTISEMENTAndy the frenchyShow all reviewsGreat scent, fresh/spicy with a fruity backbone. Great for mildly warm Spring and Summer days.Unfortunately it is much weaker than what I remember from the bottle I got as a present the year it was issued (nearly 20 years ago).Indeed it projects moderatly for 30min, before settling as a skin scent and fully disappearing after just 3hrs. Worth it at discounted price, but I m sad they destroyed my memories... 4th May 2019216218Kaizen1972Show all reviewsVery fresh, bright fragrance from Christian Dior. Starts out with a noticeable burst of basil (great in cooking and colognes, cool ;^>) accented with spiciness including rosemary. Citrus opening notes last for an instant, mostly disappearing after drydown.Remnant is a stable cypress, along with a small aquatic tang with a slight kiss of musk.Reminiscent of 360 Degrees Red by Perry Ellis (though not as intense)and a very toned down Ralph Lauren Purple Label.Higher seems more suited for younger wearers in warmer weather. For me (being in my 40's), I can see myself wearing this for casual occasions, or for wearing around the house. 5th January 2017181118Joeyjoey70Show all reviewsThis is a very weak effort from Dior. If they were going for a weak bland scent with no longevity they did a great job. I don't believe this is anything more than cologne strength. This lasts no more than 2 hours with no projection. The quality just isn't there considering the price it's being sold for. Plenty of other quality scents at this price point that would be way more enjoyable. 8th June 2016172903Way Off ScenterShow all reviewsGenre: FougèreI have certain expectations of the house that launched Diorella, Diorissimo, Eau Sauvage, Fahrenheit, and Dune. Higher meets none of them. The only way I can explain badness as profound as this coming from Dior is as a cynical attempt to cash in on the fresh, aquatic masculine sports fragrance trend with the absolute minimum of effort or expenditure.Never mind the scent pyramid. I smell only three ingredients in Higher: Calone (fruity aquatic), an abrasive woody amber, and a clean musk that smells just like laundry detergent (only not as good).Just nasty.15th June 2014141988silentrichShow all reviewsDior Higher is a modern floral that adds uncommon notes of pear wood and cypress that makes it unique. Higher is really the perfect name for this fragrance because it's a very uplifting etheral type of fragrance. Fantastic for summer and I could also see this being worn in the spring. Higher is subtle in projection, but has a presence. This can easiliy be a unisex fragrance because of the floral elements. If I had to sum up what Higher is I would say that it's Dior Homme's little brother. I don't love Higher, but I think it's unique enough to own a bottle of and pleasant enough to wear on a regular basis. 6th November 2013128386rbakerShow all reviewsThe opening is nice and fresh with a touch of fruitylemon, but in the drydown with touches of wood, a nonspecific floweriness and a bit of wood that merges with a smidgeon of a musky notes it remains a bit insipid on my skin. Projection is poor, and a longevity of less than two hours in this type of scent is not satisfactory. 5th January 2013122257Franco65Show all reviewsfor teen agers, regretted it buying the second time, must be augmented with patchouli or drakkar noir for better depth 9th July 2012113327jonuiucShow all reviewsA light but very persistant smell. Delicate and flowery and almost too feminine to my nose now. I bought this in my twenties and it fell out of use. Not offensive since its subtle but I found since its so light it is easy to over do-it, the projection is rather good. I regifted the cologne but kept the bar soap, which is a nice change up for business suits and the like, when wearing cologne would not be appropriate. 29th February 2012105842DarvantShow all reviewsBare as a street of the Kiev's perifery, sadly lemony, angular, colourless and dry. The beginning is nothing than  tasteless and artificial greens, synthetic fruity-ozonic chord and lemon. In a so dry fragrance the link of green apple, basil and lemon is overly astringent and almost acid. I don't see any trace of montaneous aroma in the wake despite the presence of rosemary and cypress.  The higher balsamic wake of Blenheim Bouquet is so far over the moon. The spices are nothing than pepper under my nose, anyway are dry, sugarless and stuck. I don't detect ambergris in the dry down ( it's the pepper that  imprints masculine final dustiness i suppose) but just a laundry musk and some neutral woods unable to colour this onedimentional aquatic. Anonymous as whatever Zegna or Boss out there. 10th October 201198899blackenedShow all reviewsHigher by Dior? I like it , energetic opening tending to lemon and pear with a touch of sexy spices , in the middle phase becomes an elegant and charming floral :unmistakable signature of Dior house.It has a certain air to eau de rochas man but the one from Dior is more floral in its stele.It´s a pity its poor longevity because immediately stay close to skin.If only it would project more... 27th October 2010101150colormechrisShow all reviewsLet's face it. The French are the masters of perfume. Nine times out of ten, you pick up a bottle where the juice has impressed you enough to try to read that teeny-tiny printing and it says: Made In France. It's in their blood. Like pizza, French perfume seems to ascribe to the adage: \"Even when it's bad, it's pretty good\". Such is the case with Dior Higher. Clearly this is being pitched to a younger demographic with the high-tech package and the \"fresh\" juice within. And certainly better things have come out of France and the House of Dior (a whole bunch of true classics). Higher is never going to be placed on a pedastal next to say, Eau Sauvage or Diorissimo; and by Dior's standards it definitely falls on the lower end of their QC scale...But, all in all, it's not bad. A spicy/fresh no-nonsense affair that you can just squirt and go without having to think about it. Pear is not the first note you might think of wearing, but who doesn't like the smell of pears? Doesn't have the greatest projection or sillage. Seems this would do best in the Summer months. And you can just toss the decanter into a briefcase or whatever...it's all ready \"travel style\". 12th May 201030033BigslyShow all reviewsThe pyramid looks accurate, but the spices are mild. This is natural smelling, and has decent projection/\"sillage\" and longevity for me. The musk is mild, and it is well balanced. This is not what I usually look for in a fragrance, and I obtained it as part of a lot purchase, but I now enjoy it as a \"change of pace.\" I think of it as a dry, herbal, woody with a touch of pear. One reviewer compared this to Tommy, but I find that one to be a bit too strong and simple now. Higher has nice dynamism to it, so that it's hard to pin down what's going on, and my guess is that some people really don't like that, and prefer the more straightforward approach. I can't speak to top notes because I try to avoid them, but once they are mostly gone, this is rather linear and you either like what remains or you don't. I doubt I would ever buy a bottle, because it is a bit too expensive for my budget, but I can see how some really like it. There may be better fragrances of this type, but because I haven't sampled many I can only base my review on a few (assuming that you too think that Tommy should be compared to this one). Because I like the dynamism and balance, and because I like it once in a while, I'll give it a positive, though I would agree that it's not \"special.\" 26th January 201050976warlandsboyShow all reviewsDamn the opening to this one is RAUNCHY! Peeee-ewwwww! LMAO Thankfully its died down within a matter of minutes. I'm getting a picture in my head of mold...fresh, wet, stinky mold with a definite sharpness to it. I could definitely see spraying this on someone as some sort of practical joke...or perhaps the joke is on me? 4th September 200972325Mario JustinianiShow all reviewsA fruity three star scent which according to 'The Basenotes Says' info is:\"The latest male launch from Dior, 4 years on from Dune for Men. Desgned (sic) for the youth market, ( My guess is 15 year olds--or former users Aqua di Gio which really amounts to the same thing ) this is very fresh ( What! The young are buying fresh scents at the mall? Stop the presses!)and has an eye catching bottle.\"Still, I'd like to give it a thumbs up for ebullience ( um--did I spell that right?) it reminds me of Clinique Happy, Quasar and Paco's XS, only with pears. I'd like to but . . .28th April 200988938vdxxlShow all reviewsNice for a fresh cologne. It smells refined, it really suits urban fashion. Great for a night in town. Great for students. It is fresh, but not generic, it is natural smelling, which you cannot find in fresh fragrances( Ozone Mist, Sea Scents- all of these are synthetic). Go ahead if you hate aquatics, but love fresh-chypre cologne. 30th March 200930113PigeonMurdererShow all reviewsInteresting to see all the complaints about the lasting power. Oddly this scent lasts on me fairly well; I have no complaints.And I kind of like the juice in itself, too. I keep thinking I probably shouldn't just because it's not my usual style, but damn, this is one enjoyable scent.Very happy and playful fresh juicy fruit notes. It turns more towards woods and musk in the drydown.Well balanced refreshing juice. Nothing spectacular, it's a little scent after all, but it is worth to try and let me say I have experienced admiration towards this one from some females too. And that has been a real rare treat for me, unfortunately. 15th February 200917202lu'luShow all reviewsBoth Dior Higher and Higher Energy has a weak longevity, it stays on skin for about 10 to 15 minutes then with an open arms, it allows your body odor to take over. However, speaking of fragrance accord, Higher offers a pleasant, light citrus opening, very refined and subtle, later on the fragrance evolves to something which is herbal fresh, spicy and woody. Yet, the herbal freshness is not like any other 'green' fragrance, its progress is beautifully controlled as it surface. The bottle is beautifully made, simple yet truly an eye-catcher. IMO, the fragrance accord is wonderfully made, but considering that Higher is from Dior, a fragrance powerhouse, its weak longevity is totally unforgiven. 5th November 200862571Kabamaru ninjaShow all reviewsI was waiting not to like it,but I was wrong!Its a spicy dry fresh sweet long lasting scent.Also its strong enough to satisfy me,not like its \"cousin\" Higher Energythat smells different (clean and better) but is very weak in compere to this. Higher is Dior's spicy and a little sporty\"child\".Unique scent! 3rd October 200861327rodentShow all reviewsThis is one ingredient list that actually looks accurate; the opening notes are almost all citrus, pear and basil. The combination of the latter two is astonishingly inventive -- it's very slightly sweet without being sweet in a gourmand sense, and pungent without being spicy in the conventional sense -- and really works. The scent goes through a fairly synthetic-smelling fresh phase before it winds down into its somewhat musky drydown -- which, incidentally, isn't terribly complex or exciting. But having said all this -- Higher really works. It comes across as a modern, fresh scent that fits squarely into the aquatic / fresh paradigm of the late 90s -- yet manages to smell quite different from anything else out there due to the pear and basil combo. Sillage is really excellent as it's quite a sharp juice. Great one for a 35 and under crowd -- a bit frisky for everyone else, but wearable. 23rd September 200842905jensonShow all reviewsWell, not a single review here comes remotely close to describing how this scent actually smells. I am really surprised by all the negative and neutral reviews on this one. Lame, that I am explaining how a scent smells but ill give it a shot considering this one is a scent that I like him a lot. This is clearly a scent in disguise, by this I mean, it's heart which forms the woody notes actually spreads it tentacles to top notes almost immediately on application with underlying musk notes giving it a satin smooth powdery effect. The pear note emerges into forefront with a silver lining along with gentle citrus notes. The citrus is not done in an L'eau D'Issey or a CK one way...it very beautifully plays a supporting role to the entire progression. This one is very powdery and settles down to a very musky, woody note. just like SMW, there is a signature note in this one, maybe the pear. It adds character to this scent. 7-8 sprays last very long. a big thumbs up coz its different and not run of the mill types. 23rd September 200844702foetidusShow all reviewsI do not like the opening. To my nose it has a very off note that smells like something like moldy varnish. I think the moldy varnish is a really distorted rosemary / pepper / cold spice accord that is the cause of this annoyance: Higher has a poorly executed use of spices, in my opinion. I think the cypress is in there, but it comes through muddled in with the spice accord. The base is primarily wood: An uninspired wood that has a hard time vying with the annoying spice accord that seems to have way too much longevity. Frankly, I don't like this one at all. 23rd August 20086680SirSlartyShow all reviewsPepper. Like maybe a crumb of it. In water. This is so dilute that I think the name refers to the meniscus of the alcohol in the test tube they used to make the scent the scent. 11th July 20084784812 Next Most reviews in the last weekmanlyscents (8)Colbourne (8)Varanis Ridari (4)landshark321 (3)exmin (3)speedracer (3)RoamingRose (3)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)SPACEDOUT (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (28)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (8)Lian (7)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

I smelled it in a magazine as a teenager and fell in love. I’ve had the same bottle since around 2001 (the Cosmair version) I don’t know why, but I’ve never used this on my wrist until recently. I ended up getting some really pleasant palo santo woody notes that I never got from my neck. This is the most active scent I own, in that it changes and moves throughout the day. It feels alive, like it will politely step aside and allow me to enjoy other scents when they show up. It has some spicy ambery notes that end up smelling of maple syrup on my neck. I adore this cologne. It gives your nose a lot to do. 2nd February 2024278281Varanis RidariShow all reviewsPolo Sport by Ralph Lauren (1993) was a very big deal when it launched, and became the go-to scent for many a \"gym bro\" back in the day, who were composed entirely of muscle, libido, and a desire to beat everyone at everything in which one could possibly declare a winner and loser. This was the smell of unbridled ego-driven whey-fueled insecurity for much of the 90's, a market that would be tapped into heavily until the 2000's, and if you so dare as got even unintentionally in the path of one such meathead doused in Polo Sport on his way in or out the door, you'd be on the receiving end of either an arrogant quip or possibly a shiner. Now not everyone wearing Polo Sport is or was a self-centered \"Chad\", as a lot of impressionable teenage boys and young men throughout the time Polo Sport reigned supreme wore it to be \"on trend\", much in the same way Davidoff Cool Water (1988) was also worn to absolute death. For my experience, this was one of the few scents you were almost required to own if you were going to own any at all coming up through high school by the end of the decade, as wearing something so popular that onlookers could recognize your scent was actually encouraged rather than frowned upon like it seems to be now. Polo Sport wasn't so much an important release for incidentally becoming the territorial pissings of steroid abusers during the 90's, but rather because it furthered the aquatic genre put into being by the aforementioned Cool Water and eventually the \"blue fragrance\" category. There were other attempts at emulating the accord founded by the erstwhile Davidoff mega-hit, but nobody really tried to advance the state of the art quite like Harry Freemont did with Polo Sport. Becoming the number-one \"sports scent\" among males for a time is no small feat, but the combination of oceanic tones with a richer earthy/woody underpinning was one sure-fire way to make it happen. Polo Sport is by far the final word in \"blue\" aquatics, and there would be at least one or two more great leaps in the genre until it lay dormant to be reawakened without so much \"blue\" midway through the 2000's, but it's still pretty important because the abstract concept of a fruity fresh \"blue\" masculine fragrance really solidified with Polo Sport, evolving more when Bleu de Chanel (2010) showed up to change the game by removing the aquatic elements. The cobalt-colored bottle reminiscent of a sports canteen is crowned with a cap and resembling a bar/knob from a free weight or piece of athletic equipment, housing a juice that itself would be copied countless times for the next 15 years or so. Polo Sport fused fruity minty top notes with smooth cool spices and a unique sea grass note in the heart, then finished with a woody aromatic base laced with the prerequisite dihydromyrcenol \"aquatic\" note. Opening with mandarin, tangerine, pineapple, mint, lavender and neroli, Polo Sport confronts you with a dynamic contrast of fruity sweet, cool, sharply citric, slightly-medicinal aura that sets up for the green vegetal sea grass heart mixed with geranium and rosewood. This heart is the most-iconic feature of Polo Sport, and is the part that would become most-copied as the 90's went on, quickly stealing the title of \"aquatic gold standard\" away from Cool Water, which itself has by comparison received far fewer clones over the years. From there, we move into a more-conventional base of musk, oakmoss, patchouli, and sandalwood with the \"aquatic\" note moving between them, but this is also a bit unconventional in a way too, because it was far heavier and more aromatic than what few aquatics arrived on the scene prior, and definitely has more depth than Cool Water itself. What we're left with is an accord that provides a semi-sweet fresh crisp experience with dynamism up top mixed with a vegetal quality of the heart that very gradually moves the slider into aromatic woods and musk territory as the base takes over. Polo Sport is a suprisingly unpretentious fragrance since it offers up approachable freshness and inviting warmth when you get close, which seems all the more ironic that it was pitched as a sport scent and worn by a bunch of Gold's Gym flunkies looking to get in everyone's pants or scare them off the dance floor with arms too big to do much more than the cabbage patch when C&C Music Factory started cranking at the Roxbury. Where you would use this now is anyone's guess, as Polo Sport has moved so far away from the common masculine vernacular that wearing it around millennials might actually catch people off-guard regardless of context or time of year, but this feels more summery than anything else even if it has enough weight for general use. You won't get looks of concern like you might wearing an 80's powerhouse or 70's aromatic, but you'd definitely get some folks trying to place where they've smelled it before if you sport it on an outing.As for performance, conflicting opinions exist about pre-and-post-2011 batches, or before and after oakmoss was heavily restricted and mostly replaced with evernyl for the houses unwilling to pay up on the low-atranol treated oakmoss available nowadays. For my part, the modern version of Polo Sport still \"smells like Polo Sport\", and wears with moderate projection and longevity. This was never a \"beast-mode\" fragrance from the onset, but most people experiencing Polo Sport back in its prime were also experiencing an over-application on the wearer's part in many cases, with rose-tinted glasses and hobbyist knowledge doing the rest for some guys to assert that vintage is stronger/better because it had more oakmoss. If you prefer it, then by all means seek vintage out, but people new to Polo Sport will still \"get the point\" with what's commonly out there. Jean Patou took the depth of Polo Sport's base even further with the oakmoss-stuffed Voyageur (1994), a fragrance that isn't even possible to make under current IFRA regulations, so if oakmoss content is important to you, then I'd not look to this scent for satisfaction anyway. Wings for Men by Giorgio Beverly Hills (1994) is the next logical leap for folks who enjoy the \"blueness\" of Polo Sport, as Wings for Men is the \"bluest\" aquatic I have ever smelled. For everyone else, Polo Sport is the once-ubiquitous turning point in men's fragrances where \"sport\" was more of a marketing gimmick than an actual olfactive aesthetic, and remains something that at least needs to be experienced once if not worn or enjoyed alongside Polo Blue (2002), as a critical step towards where mass-appeal masculine perfumes have gone. I still enjoy the occasional sniff from Polo Sport when I find an old tester here or there, but wearing this is like strapping on my JNCO jeans and tossing a Korn CD into my stereo, and I'm not testosterone-filled or close to having pectorals bursting from a purposely too-tight shirt to own a bottle unironically. Still, for the guy looking to rock some old-school aquatics (feels wrong placing those two terms together but here we are), Polo Sport is probably the best starting place because it shares the most DNA with what's out there now than anything else made back then, and still smells pretty damn good too. Just please remember to rack your weights when you're done with them, since not all of us can bench press a SmartCar like you, thanks. Thumbs up. 12th January 2020224892ADVERTISEMENTtinfoilhatdudeShow all reviewsWore this during High School in the mid-late 90's, so I'm used to the vintage formula. Was a great starter for getting into fragrances, but every single person I knew had a bottle and wore it often. 6.5 out of 10, too bad for IFRA regs. I definitely wouldn't care to smell a current formula, and to drop the coin on a vintage bottle? Why bother with so many better vintage choices?To the good 'ol days... 22nd June 2019218062Hugh V.Show all reviews*reformulated version with the clear blue spray nozzle*This opens up much like Calvin Klein's Eternity. It's sharp and sweet, but with a blue smell to it, if that makes sense. And like Eternity, the sharpness in the opening gradually fades away to reveal a much softer interpretation of it. To me, it's somewhat linear, in a good way. I've heard reports that this isn't as good as the Cosmair version. That it even smells bad. I've never tried the original, but the bottle I did sample smelled really nice and pleasant. SMELLS LIKE:Aqua Velva Ice Sport. Almost the exact same, except Polo Sport obviously lasts longer, and has a better dry down. Also, Aqua Quorum. CONCLUSION:I like this scent, but it's not really mature. This feels like something a high schooler would wear. Almost like a starter fragrance.I think Polo Blue, and Polo Blue Sport are both a slightly more serious take on this style, although I think this one is more distinctive.Overall this is a very pleasant scent. It feels a bit dated because it reminds me of Cool Water, and that scent, for me, was synonymous with the early/mid 90s. An excellent fragrance to give you an idea what the 90s was like.26th September 2018207247DEAN jaShow all reviewsVintage formulation by Cosmair is excellent, although its practically impossible to find now.Newer reformulation severely lacks projection and longevity, and the scent disappears completely in a half hour. 13th October 2016177873BuysblindShow all reviewsIf you're going to buy this, try your best to score a vintage bottle from the 90's. I wore this a lot in high school and recently found myself in the mood to wear it again. Lo and behold it smells as good as I remember it smelling. And when you smell a vintage, you're immediately reminded of the superior quality of ingredients that were used in fragrances before all the IFRA restrictions and reformulations (the current version pales in comparison). The average sports fragrance today has none of the complexity or character of this, which although nice and cutting edge, was nothing spectacularly complex in its day. Polo Sport is a tart aquatic, blending fresh fruity notes with a salty, marine/seaweed sort of smell. It mixes sour with salty and sweet to create something reminiscent of coastal breezes, perhaps in cooler, northern climates, as it's certainly not tropical in any way. It's distinct, and despite the plethora of sports fragrance which have been produced since its inception, Polo Sport retains some degree of originality, easy to identify and fairly memorable. While the vintage bottle I use smells great, its longevity may have suffered over time, as it lasts only about 3 or 4 hours before it's gone. I'm not hugely nostalgic about fragrances and rarely yearn for scents of yesteryear, but Polo Sport is one that manages to scatch that itch while also smelling good enough and modern enough to continue wearing today. Give me this, Polo Green, and Cool Water's Lancaster version and I'm pretty much set as far as vintage is concerned. Thumbs up, with a warning to avoid the current formulation in favor of vintage if possible. 4th October 2016177613gdtrfb895Show all reviewsWished they still made this. Yes it is synthetic, but I used to get more compliments on this than any other fragrance. Great frag for the gym applied sparingly. Many aquatics have come after this one but they haven't really improved much. Love the clean pineapple and seaweed notes that smell clean aquatic but not fishy. I think this one just really works with my body chemistry. 4th December 2015165049OCNBreeze7Show all reviewsThe Original Polo Sport... A great fragrance that we will miss... One of the classic fragrance designers, Ralph Lauren, has produced a number of scents we have grown to love. It is too bad that some of these fragrances have run their course and \"put out to pasture\" - so to speak. Polo Sport is one of these fragrances that became a classic, but with time, has become increasingly hard to find. Perhaps it, too, has been discontinued. I recently purchased this fragrance online and could hardly await arrival of the scent that became popular in the mid-90s - as a mid-40s guy (and still roguishly handsome) - I remember this time period fondly... Out of the bottle Polo Sport presents a complexity of notes, but settles into simplicity of citrus, fruity, and \"woodsy\" notes. A classic scent that is breathes clean, fresh, and distinguished. Well done, Mr. Lauren..!! While the longevity and projection/sillage of this new bottle is average, it seems that bottles produced in the late 90s or early 00s, the fragrance lasted longer with greater sillage. There have been comparisons to younger siblings, \"Red, White, and Blue\" and \"Polo Blue Sport\" - I am not sure I get those same notes. Each are great fragrances, but very much different than this blend. Polo Sport has plenty of \"Wow Factor\" (compliments from the opposite sex) potential. The first day I wore this, I did not receive any compliments, but due to it's fresh and clean wake, the potential is there. One of the beauties about Polo Sport is the versatility or flexibility - perhaps tailored more for Spring and Summer, I feel confident the fragrance can be worn any time of year and for any occasion. It also can be a favorite for all ages - those of us who grew up with Polo Sport and the younger audience who want to feel clean and fresh. The bottle is an exceptional and classic design - typical Ralph Lauren.. As mentioned, I purchased this online. That said, the packaging is average at best. I, generally, am not a \"conspiracy theory\" type of guy, but I have pondered the thought of authenticity of this purchase. (I will add the purchase was through a very reputable source..) Regardless, the packaging is average or modest.Speaking of the purchase, Polo Sport can still be found moderately priced. My final tally of Polo Sport is 4.3 stars out of 5. Yes, there may be better fragrances out there - even I have those that rank higher - but Polo Sport is truly a classic fragrance that I enjoy. I highly recommend adding to your collection - or for us 40+ more distinguished gentlemen (and I use that term 'loosely'..), replenishing our cologne cabinet with a new bottle of Polo Sport.The Daily I.M. - The best thing in the world, is the world itself (from one of my favorite movies). Make your life count... 10th April 2014137967delShow all reviewsLight, Pleasant, Fresh and Clean Aquatic I'm typing this review based on my nice memories of Polo Sport: it was the bomb during my college years, and everyone seemed to love it back then, as it smelled fresh, clean, and a little fruity-sweet.   The initial alcohol-y blast projects widely, like the fume is morphing to a hand gently guiding your nose to the wearer. I still remember how it used to turn heads minutes after application. Polo Sport quickly becomes a pleasant aquatic after that.   Polo Sport isn't a bad fragrance, but it is light, so it lacks lasting power. If you really like the scent, make sure to carry a splash mini-bottle and reapply as needed like I did back in college.Pros: Pleasant and a head-turnerCons: Fades quickly 21st May 2013129478sjg3839Show all reviewsGreat scent I use to wear years ago. Aquatic fresh with a touch of citrus. I would actually still purchase a bottle of this today. 3rd October 2012134141DutchSchwagShow all reviewsHarry Fremont's resume certainly needs no introduction; the man who a year later dropped CK One on the masses, was already well ahead of the curve on the aquatic revolution when he came up with Polo Sport. Polo Sport is thick with seaweed throughout, with a nice touch of citrus in the opening before completely giving way to the dominant seaweed note for the rest of the dry-down.Certainly shocks and disorients the uninitiated because it is so different from the standard fragrance. The opening is very think with seaweed and cloying citrus, but after a few moments the ginger creeps into the seaweed and creates a spicier, less projecting dry-down that uses many of the standard Polo elements and notes, which don't seem to be able to assert themselves over the heavy dose of seaweed. Works well with natural skin chemistry, producing a natural, warm and organic scent that wears close to the skin and manages to mask most body odors during physical activity. Given the \"sport\" monicker for that reason, but really this is more of a beach fragrance that resonates strongly with those who have spent an early, misty morning on a Northern Californian or Southern Oregonian pacific shore. This is one of the best souvenirs one can pick up to bring back images of the colder beaches of the northern California coast, wealthy in sea-life and seaweed along its banks. Projection and silage are fairly average, with longevity a bit of an issue, usually under 4-5 hours and wearing very close to the skin. Still, if you can appreciate more organic scents like seaweed, this is an incredibly original and unique extension of using organic notes. Polo Sport is very unique for its time, most likely more than a little inspired by the success of Nautica the year before and the influx of newer, trendier Polo inspired fashion houses taking a large portion of the 20 something crowd. The packaging itself reflects a time when the Ralph Lauren name was more vulnerable and less self-assured, trying to modernize with a new logo to go with its new jeans line, in an attempt to break from its illustrious past and more emphatically, the Baby Boomer generation. Polo Sport was Ralph Lauren's deliberate attempt to capture Generation X. Not refined for formal wear, but a fantastic, casual alternative to the plethora of synthetics on the market, Sport is original, organic and oceanic, like driving along Pacific 1 Highway with the top down on a September morning. A best seller largely because of the Polo name, but the Polo name does still stand for quality fabrics, oils and materials and not taking shortcuts in China. The Pacific Ocean in a bottle. Overall 4/5 (Quality 3.5/Originality 4.75/Projection 2.5/Longevity 2.5/Value 3.0/Scent 4.0) 17th November 2011100775Chuck18293Show all reviewsI remember this fragrance back in the day when it was my signature sent It's fresh and clean and smells like body wash, like a nice and clean showerand it's a little bit floral tooOn my skin this last about 8-10 hours wich is greatBut i Wouldn't buy it again beacause I wore it a lot of time maybe just a 75 mlBut It's a very good fragance i think!And a Machine of Compliments the girls love it!!! 11th August 201078697jcastanoShow all reviewsI never knew too much about Polo fragrances but when I saw this at Marshalls for $25 for a 4.2 oz bottle, I thought, why not get it, it's a good deal. I was expecting something to blow me out of this world since everyone I've ever known has put this on a pedestal but unfortunatley, that wasn't the case. At first, I thought it smelled odd? The seaweed note and citrus notes threw me off and there was something about it that smelled dirty, almost like salty, bitter sweat. I know, it sounds weird but I really got that vibe from it! I hated it at first but after wearing it a few more times after that, I must say it grew on me. I actually love the seaweed note in it now and the salty, bitter sweat vibe I used to get from it is no longer there.The aquatic feel to this fragrance is actually very well done and although very synthetic, the combination of citrus, florals, woods, and musk give it a type of character that truly captures the idea of a fresh water ocean, something that I've yet to smell with any other sport fragrance. It's semi-sweet yet green, but has this animalic aura to it but musk tends to do that, and the aldehydes give it a clean, very fresh touch that might even give of the impression of laundry detergent. This fragrance is excellent if you want something different from all the usual aquatic/sport colognes for men out there. I can't imagine why this wasn't so groundbreaking when it first arrived on the scene back in the early 90's. I just imagine myself running on a beach on a warm, sunny day, when all the sudden, a light breeze picks up and freshens the air while it wafts the smell of the deep blue sea all throughout . It's a scent that's great for spring/summer. Its sillage and longevity is fantastic, and uniqueness is a most definite A+! The one thing that this fragrance lacks is in its versatility, but not by much. I wouldn't recommend wearing this in a suit and tie or in any formal attire like one can with most other sport frags (Allure Sport, Dior Sport) because it lacks that \"sophistication\" factor, but if you're the casual type of guy in a t-shirt and jeans or shorts, this is perfect! Overall rating in my book, B+ 8th April 201091536aktp-iciookShow all reviewsHighly masculine in a fresh, aquatic and sporty sense.Sea weed note in Polo Sport is so unique and really fascinating to me.Cheers, 11th February 201071706D.SpradShow all reviewsThis one brings back memories of a trip to Virginia Beach a few years ago. The seaweed in this one must bring me back to that one.I enjoy the memories, and the scent itself isn't too bad, really!I'm never put off by the seaweed, and those I know (both male and female) haven't been either.The opening, like DiamondFlame said, is a jolt many times, and the dry-down is pleasant and semi-sweet.Don't be fooled by the \"Sport\" in Polo Sport. I know plenty of \"Sport\" and \"Fresh\" fragrances that really are just awful have been floating out there for a while, but this one is worth a try, really! 21st November 200974061smellofvictoryShow all reviewsvery unique fresh scent...similar to Cool Water yet very different. Liked this since I was in junior high. 20th September 200972958DiamondflameShow all reviewsI grew up near the sea so I know the smell of seaweed; it is essentially briny but probably too subtle to have that much of an impact on a fragrance. In any case Ralph Lauren's website only mentions a 'sea breeze' accord which instantly made me think of Ferragamo's Subtil, just not POLO SPORT. For me, this scent opens with an effervescent, alcohol-fueled sucker punch which jolts you awake before settling down to a sweet somewhat boozy miasma of 'cucumber and melon', to my nose at least, without relying on cheat sheets. I know fresh aquatics get little love around here but this one gets mine; I finished 2 bottles of the juice! So if you're sick of yours, be a sport, send them my way. And remind me again why Cool Water finished second best in the early '90s. 18th September 200970342MrFragranceReviewShow all reviewsI was very apprehensive about buying this cologne because it smelled very mediocre at first but strangely had a unique note to it. I purchased it more for the fact that my girlfriend LOVES it. It's a deep seaweed smell that tries to be fresh and slightly citrusy. No notes really stand out too much and I like that. The more I wear the more I appreciate it. It's a fantastic gym scent just don't over do it. If applied well this smell is gorgeous and well done. The problem is, it's a younger scent typically and young guys tend to over apply so there are many negative associations with this fragrance. I can see why she likes it so much and I can see why so many women feel the same way. It's typically used as a gym scent and guys wearing very casual white t-shirts, shorts and working hard and getting sweaty. They associate that with this smell and they find it sexy. 1st September 200971863CougartownShow all reviewsMinty, bright, fresh, and very strong. Exactly what the tried to do, most likely. Old school, high schooler appropriate, but very good. 5th June 200969576MFJShow all reviewsI find Polo Sport to be very much in the same vein as Cool Water and Eternity, both of which, I thoroughly enjoy. There is a clean, minty-fresh vibe to Polo Sport that is rather uplifting and invigorating. I get a nice leafy aroma as well. Well popular in the 90s, and for good reasons. It does seemed designed to evoke the imagery of \"fresh masculinity\". 18th May 200956631AdamaShow all reviewsMy first frag, chosen by my girlfriend because of its inoffensive nature. Strong, fresh opening. Seaweed is really dominant; very salty and unique. Reminds me heavily of an ocean breeze, but there's something that is just a bit off that ruins the illusion.It calms down after the first few minutes and moves quickly into a barely detectable woody musk.I use this stuff for the gym now, since A) It smells nicer when you're working out and B) I don't like it as much as my other frags. For $75, you can find cheaper gym-frags.Edit: I've been going back and re-reviewing my old reviews. Polo Sport was my first cologne, and I've yet to find an Aquatic better than it, despite my searching. Sport is a perfect blend that not only exemplifies the Aquatic genre, but also uses the Seaweed note in a way that is tremendously pleasant.Salty and watery, Sport is still the best at what it does 21 years after it hit the market.Changed from a Neutral to a Thumbs Up, which I should have done years ago. 14th October 2008135368NoraedShow all reviewsFresh, cool and clean scent. It is an Aromatic - Rustic type of perfume. Smells, like lemon, mint, musk and other refreshing notes I cannot describe. I don't know why, but it reminds me of shiny silver and waterfalls. My husband has it. I like it, but he does not think it is special. 27th April 200853410wingerShow all reviewsI can sum this fragrence up in 1 word. CLASSIC.

Reminds me of starting work/college and going to pubs for the very first time. It had a shower fresh smell to it and I remember it being rather cloying. Not sure what it smells like these days?? 15th November 2017193965ADVERTISEMENTWay Off ScenterShow all reviewsGenre: FougèreIt's blue, it says sport on the bottle, and, surprise, it's a fresh, fruity-aquatic fougère. What were you expecting  Knize Ten? Heaven knows the world needs more fragrances like this  but only if we find a way to make their fumes fuel an automobile or a city bus. Attempting pineapple in lieu of the usual apple, Polo Sport is on the tart side as its ilk goes, which might make the industrial chemical aquatic accord more tolerable than elsewhere. But only by degree. In my book Polo Sport is no more or less superfluous than any other blue fragrance for men, and guys who want something of this sort will get what they expect from it. I only wonder why they would want it?23rd June 2014144310dallasfanShow all reviewsIt's a good clean scent, smells like a good shower, good office/school scent I have a few samples, i won't by the bottle though, because there are other similar scents out there, and because it's polo it's too expensive for something thats only decent. If i saw a bottle in the store for like $20-$25 I might think about it if i have the extra money. If you can find it for cheap, and you're relatively new with fragrances i'd reccomend it, but otherwise i wouldn't, it's nice but not worth $40Pros: Smells nice and it's lightCons: Doesn't project too well and doesn't very long\" 17th August 2013131106emad91Show all reviewsA Good Cologne For Daily Use. I bought it last night...i just love the fragrance. Those sweet woody citrus notes. Its good for daily rough use and for winters i would say as colognes lasts a lil longer in winters. One can use it in summers too but just for a rough daily use. It fades very quickly.Pros: Smells lovely.Cons: Projection and Sillage not as expected.\" 13th August 2013131016DarvantShow all reviewsThe infamous range of the aquatics is not  my favourite genre of fragrances although i don't abhor those aprioristically just for their provenance and placing.  I have to admit that some woodsy-aquatics or aromatic-ozonic fougere and oceanic kind of watery fragrances surprised me a lot and i don't dislike for sure fragrances as Kenzo Pour Homme, Bvlgari Aqua, Sel de Vetiver The Different Company, Aqua Quorum Puig, the wonderful Horizon Laroche or New West For Him by Aramis. I use to appreciate that rare sense of silvan, aromatic (mint, artemisia, verbena, thyme etc), exotic, airy, naturally and deeply oceanic  freshness in the world of scents and many (aquatics or not) manage to satisfy this feel for sure. I use on the contrary to fully dislike the chemics and the metal, i mean the excessively detergent-fruity-floral ozonic scents (like L'Eau D'Issey which anyway has its qualities), the  soapy-chemical-detergent like shower foams (Blu Pour Homme , Heaven Chopard), the metallic (Echo Davidoff, Chrome Azzaro, Chrome Legend, DKNY Men, Acqua di Gio' Pour Homme etc), the sparkling-energizing sporty kind of aquatics (Allure Sport Chanel, Byblos Uomo, Burberry Sport Men, etc., etc., etc.). Polo Sport (i swear i'm not misleaded just by the name) takes unfortunately part of this family (with its uncompromisingly aquatic,watermelon kind, orangy accord of seaweeds, citrus, pineapple and musk) together with dozens of Byblos, Boss, Armani, Miyake, Dolce &Gabbana, Bvlgari and going on till the end of the world, out there. Slightly better Cool Water Davidoff with  its less chemical feel, its better equipped balance and its touch of aromatic woodsy feel. The note of ginger (Bvlgari Blue, Byblos Uomo etc.) uses to imprint  that sort of cool and detergent spark that makes me thinking to a shower gel and not to a real well structured fragrance, so Polo Sport does and the final \"sporty-deodorant-detergent\" feel surpasses sense of elegance and virile sharp sophistication. Good shower and after shower with Polo Sport my friends. 30th December 2011133051colormechrisShow all reviewsWell, Polo Sport has a soft spot in my heart because I worked at the Polo store on Rodeo Drive when it first came out. That was an experience, and the smell of PSport brings it all back. Ralph himself even came in once with his wife and they just kind of stood around watching. Or were they sniffing? Cool Water had come out in 1988 but was just reaching the height of its popularity. Mr. Lauren, no dummy, knew a good thing when he smelled it. Thus Polo Sport was born. Let's not use the phrase \"rip off\". Ralph would never do that! But to say Polo Sport wasn't a direct descendent of Cool Water wouldn't be true either.The place was infused with the stuff. It was at every register. Perhaps I associate the cologne with clothing so the next logical step is laundry detergent. And it still smells that way to me. Like a big bottle of ALL or FAB or something. That's not neccessarily bad; but scented laundry detergent isn't exactly the height of olfactory finesse. And Polo Sport has about as much finesse as a box of Tide. But still...It has a certain fun, uplifting appeal to it, much like Clinique Happy. The fruit here, however, is not the ever dependable orange, but pineapple. Mixed with a ton of apparent aldehydes, the entire effect is sort of a CGI of Waikiki Beach. A \"seaweed\" note is said to be in each phase of the perfume, but nothing in there smells like seaweed to me. Seaweed is salty and earthy smelling. Polo Sport is sweet from start to finish.To sum, it's a great no-brainer for hot weather and hanging out at the beach, the lake, the pool...but go easy. It can annoy worse than a bratty teen-ager, and has about as much depth. But it can make you smile too. 30th January 201183979urflinessShow all reviewsI don't get what all the flak is about.I agree there is nothing spectacular about this fragrance. However in my opinion there is nothing that smells worse than Dior Farenheit.give polo sport a break.Trust me there is worse out there. 12th April 201066478micciShow all reviewsOne of those fresh, safe frags...not very creative but I don't think it's too generic either as far as the 'aqua-blue' bit goes....There is something earthy about the dry down that sets it apart...It definitely tops it's league so go ahead and grab one for yourself. 27th January 201044533ScentaurShow all reviewsIt really is suitable for sport or gym wear. The impact of this scent is better during the 90s. If you're feeling nostalgic, then go help yourself with this one.

It finally leveled out and some of the freshness I enjoyed was there but I still kept getting that maple syrup smell in between that turned me off. 2nd September 200856198AndrewthecologneguyShow all reviewsI have never held seaweed up to my nose to see what it smells like, but I guess that 'weired' initially burst from Polo sport is it. I bought this because i like the bottle and I remember a friend having this back in college and it was quite different. It reminds me of a sample of Nautica Competition (blue bottle) that I got and threw away because it was just awful, except Polo Sport doesn't possess the 'gasoline' accord in the Nautica. I saw a relaunch of the Nautica later (yellow packaging) and I guess they realized how bad the initial smelled or more likely that Polo Sport was on the money and the Nautica wasn't. Definately not for everybody, but something to tickle your nose if you don't want to wear anything else (does that make sense?) 31st July 200733860deepthoughtShow all reviewsI am currently swimming in a sea of seaweed, which isn't so surprising considering I have just sprayed myself with RL Sport. I just can't get my nose to dig out the 'fresh' notes in it. I'm sure this has certain applications where it works (see previous reviews) but I'm not into sailing ;) 11th September 20064690woodbaneShow all reviewsHow is it possible for a frag to have seaweed as top, middle and base notes? Because it's probably made from it, that's how!!!Long considered the 'athletes classic' this fragrance is a typical locker room smell that can be harsh on the nose, especially when combined with sweat. Wear it lightly with linen pants, a cotton shirt and sandals doen at the marina and you might be surprised how good it can be. 5th May 200624996QuietEarthShow all reviewsIt just occurred to me that if this were a movie, it would be a light, fluffy, pointless Hollywood Romantic Comedy with Julia Roberts and/or Matthew McConnachy. It's a perfectly nice smell, but there's no depth to it, no complexity. It's oh-so-slightly tangier or sharper than Polo Blue but still, after the initial \"hmm that's interesting\", there's no more interest. Don't get me wrong - it's better than Eau de cigarette, but it never really gets past the peachy-keen, All-American, Star & Stripes, apple-pie cotton-candy veneer that is on the surface. Which is a shame. I expected more from Ralph Lauren. Oh, and it really doesn't last all that long, and it's hard pressed to make it's present felt after about an hour or so. Again, I own this particular \"Polo\" but come on, Ralph, you're letting me down! I'm expecting something better from that name! 4th May 200624837scenteur7Show all reviewsReally not bad - considering when it was launched. It smells great on my dad, but definitely not for me...and is it just me or does Polo Blue smell strikingly similar? 16th January 200620253dymitchellShow all reviewsIt's a good beginner's fragrance. It's a pleasant but shallow scent that gets old very quickly. 10th December 20055066MonkeyManMattShow all reviewsThe first \"real\" fragrance I ever bought and I remember being amazed how anything could smell this complex. 12 years and some 50 different bottles of fragrance later that thought seems somewhat remote...Sentimental associations aside Polo Sport is a decent release which is indeed very sporty. Somewhat similar to Kenzo PH, but inferior in quality. It is a citrussy, aquatic fragrance with a peppery bite and clear seaweed notes.Not bad at all, but so many more exciting things have come out since then.

He gave the scent four stars, calling it a \"lavender pineapple.\"I think the original Polo is offensive enough. The addition of this even worse off-shoot does the reputation of the original no good. To my nose this is a very dry, green and sharp scent and the pineapple is just stupid, only making things worse.The scent is just plain bad, as was its namesake. 2nd October 2015162493drseidShow all reviewsA very disappointing generic smelling scent from Polo. It was as if RL tries to please everyone and instead pleases none fully. I don't get any originality here at all, and if this fragrance-by-poll scent is going to smell similar to every other \"sport\" scent, why bother? Pass on this one. 2 stars out of 5. 21st August 2011121868MOONBShow all reviewsCalone and cucumber notes . . . what's not to hate? Polo Sport is a fragrance I reviewed a while ago here on basenotes, but my words somehow got lost. Let me restate them: this fragrance is mediocre from start to finish, and it's not because it's a fruity aquatic fresh fougere. I can forgive the hundreds of entries in that genre if they each offer something distinctive to it. But that's a fantastic standard. Simply put, Polo Sport offers nothing. The tangerine and accompanying citruses are a chemical byproduct of whatever form of calone was used, a fact that becomes painfully obvious the longer you wear Polo. They never really fade, but just hang in there til the end. Then there's the middle, which is quite \"cool\" feeling. Like cucumbers on your eyes, this phase braces your nose, and is perhaps the only thing about the fragrance that feels good to me. Rapidly the coolness sullies into a faded version of itself, detached and marred by some pointlessly-integrated oakmoss and a vague suggestion of green herbs. Yes, Polo Sport is clearly an agent of freshness with plenty of practical utility in the gym locker room. Beyond that, it doesn't register as a serious fragrance, and is to be avoided. Unless, of course, you wish to remain inconspicuous, in which case I would say Polo Sport is your Holy Grail. 30th April 201190614brrrryShow all reviewsI loved this back in the mid 90's. I revisited it this weekend, passing time in Ulta while my GF shopped, just for the hell of it. I really don't understand it at all. I guess it made sense when I was a 17-18 year old kid. But now at 32 I just don't get it. It didn't smell sporty to me at all. I just got a general \"spice\" smell out of it and it was terribly synthetic. Not to mention, extremely overbearing. The fact that there are so many other \"sporty\" frags out there makes Polo Sport expendable and IMO not worth sampling. 2nd February 201056390JackisblackShow all reviewsNasty. I like me some polo, but I don't like generic saline blasts. 30th September 200972780latkanShow all reviewsFor some reason i had remembered this as a great smelling frag. So when i was able to find it in my local perfume sttore i did not hesistate to buy it, a BIG mistake that was. Not only that it was the 125ml bottle so i wasted the most amount of money possible on it! It is very synthetic and smells like (agreeing with machineo) dirty socks. Lasting power, well lets just say this is not a war of atrition otherwise it would be over v v quikly!Waste of time and money completely disgusted now im left with a frag so rubbish to give to my friends [they'll think i playin a prank of some sort].

Way too much alcohol and very synthetic smelling.Why Ralph Lauren would discontinue Monogram and launch this venom is beyond me. Seaweed extract?! Are you kidding me?!This smells like glorified cough syrup!I got this bottle from someone in the industry and it's one of the few fragrances that I hated so much I gave it away. Big disappointment from Ralph Lauren. 14th May 200946546bosati05Show all reviewsI Got some for Christmas.

Why would anyone like that?I just couldn't bear to wait for the dry-down on this one, so I guess it is possible that the base notes smell quite different than the top and middle notes (although highly implausible). Unless you want to reek around the office, quickly pass this one by. 24th August 200859190SirSlartyShow all reviewsSmells like the maki used to wrap sushi rolls and dipped in pineapple juice. This is what started all the sporty junk that everyone else seems to copy. Though a classic (?) it didn't age well. Awful to my nose. 9th August 200848010thatsmr2usirShow all reviewsThis is such a terrible fragrance. The tops notes are to strong & not pleasing at all. I suppose it is the seaweed! Luckily I got this as a gift & sprayed it once and then passed it on.. The other person did not like the stinch so they just tossed it! I would not recommend this to anyone. 13th April 200849922HeidiShow all reviewsBought this a couple of years ago, since I liked it on a paper in the store.

Smells rancid, like old perfume, no sport at all... . 7th December 200633097FragranceFan255Show all reviewsOn first use Polo Sport brought to mind one horrible olfactory image native to me here in the Old South. Freshy tobacco 'juice'. To my nose someone just as well had spit a wad upon my wrist. After the top notes died down I did start to smell something that was akin to Cool Water. Well, Cool Water and tobacco 'juice'. I'll stick to the Cool Water for this fix, Mr. Lauren. 27th July 20068360zenpiperShow all reviewsAwful.

I smelled it in a magazine as a teenager and fell in love. I’ve had the same bottle since around 2001 (the Cosmair version) I don’t know why, but I’ve never used this on my wrist until recently. I ended up getting some really pleasant palo santo woody notes that I never got from my neck. This is the most active scent I own, in that it changes and moves throughout the day. It feels alive, like it will politely step aside and allow me to enjoy other scents when they show up. It has some spicy ambery notes that end up smelling of maple syrup on my neck. I adore this cologne. It gives your nose a lot to do. 2nd February 2024278281Varanis RidariShow all reviewsPolo Sport by Ralph Lauren (1993) was a very big deal when it launched, and became the go-to scent for many a \"gym bro\" back in the day, who were composed entirely of muscle, libido, and a desire to beat everyone at everything in which one could possibly declare a winner and loser. This was the smell of unbridled ego-driven whey-fueled insecurity for much of the 90's, a market that would be tapped into heavily until the 2000's, and if you so dare as got even unintentionally in the path of one such meathead doused in Polo Sport on his way in or out the door, you'd be on the receiving end of either an arrogant quip or possibly a shiner. Now not everyone wearing Polo Sport is or was a self-centered \"Chad\", as a lot of impressionable teenage boys and young men throughout the time Polo Sport reigned supreme wore it to be \"on trend\", much in the same way Davidoff Cool Water (1988) was also worn to absolute death. For my experience, this was one of the few scents you were almost required to own if you were going to own any at all coming up through high school by the end of the decade, as wearing something so popular that onlookers could recognize your scent was actually encouraged rather than frowned upon like it seems to be now. Polo Sport wasn't so much an important release for incidentally becoming the territorial pissings of steroid abusers during the 90's, but rather because it furthered the aquatic genre put into being by the aforementioned Cool Water and eventually the \"blue fragrance\" category. There were other attempts at emulating the accord founded by the erstwhile Davidoff mega-hit, but nobody really tried to advance the state of the art quite like Harry Freemont did with Polo Sport. Becoming the number-one \"sports scent\" among males for a time is no small feat, but the combination of oceanic tones with a richer earthy/woody underpinning was one sure-fire way to make it happen. Polo Sport is by far the final word in \"blue\" aquatics, and there would be at least one or two more great leaps in the genre until it lay dormant to be reawakened without so much \"blue\" midway through the 2000's, but it's still pretty important because the abstract concept of a fruity fresh \"blue\" masculine fragrance really solidified with Polo Sport, evolving more when Bleu de Chanel (2010) showed up to change the game by removing the aquatic elements. The cobalt-colored bottle reminiscent of a sports canteen is crowned with a cap and resembling a bar/knob from a free weight or piece of athletic equipment, housing a juice that itself would be copied countless times for the next 15 years or so. Polo Sport fused fruity minty top notes with smooth cool spices and a unique sea grass note in the heart, then finished with a woody aromatic base laced with the prerequisite dihydromyrcenol \"aquatic\" note. Opening with mandarin, tangerine, pineapple, mint, lavender and neroli, Polo Sport confronts you with a dynamic contrast of fruity sweet, cool, sharply citric, slightly-medicinal aura that sets up for the green vegetal sea grass heart mixed with geranium and rosewood. This heart is the most-iconic feature of Polo Sport, and is the part that would become most-copied as the 90's went on, quickly stealing the title of \"aquatic gold standard\" away from Cool Water, which itself has by comparison received far fewer clones over the years. From there, we move into a more-conventional base of musk, oakmoss, patchouli, and sandalwood with the \"aquatic\" note moving between them, but this is also a bit unconventional in a way too, because it was far heavier and more aromatic than what few aquatics arrived on the scene prior, and definitely has more depth than Cool Water itself. What we're left with is an accord that provides a semi-sweet fresh crisp experience with dynamism up top mixed with a vegetal quality of the heart that very gradually moves the slider into aromatic woods and musk territory as the base takes over. Polo Sport is a suprisingly unpretentious fragrance since it offers up approachable freshness and inviting warmth when you get close, which seems all the more ironic that it was pitched as a sport scent and worn by a bunch of Gold's Gym flunkies looking to get in everyone's pants or scare them off the dance floor with arms too big to do much more than the cabbage patch when C&C Music Factory started cranking at the Roxbury. Where you would use this now is anyone's guess, as Polo Sport has moved so far away from the common masculine vernacular that wearing it around millennials might actually catch people off-guard regardless of context or time of year, but this feels more summery than anything else even if it has enough weight for general use. You won't get looks of concern like you might wearing an 80's powerhouse or 70's aromatic, but you'd definitely get some folks trying to place where they've smelled it before if you sport it on an outing.As for performance, conflicting opinions exist about pre-and-post-2011 batches, or before and after oakmoss was heavily restricted and mostly replaced with evernyl for the houses unwilling to pay up on the low-atranol treated oakmoss available nowadays. For my part, the modern version of Polo Sport still \"smells like Polo Sport\", and wears with moderate projection and longevity. This was never a \"beast-mode\" fragrance from the onset, but most people experiencing Polo Sport back in its prime were also experiencing an over-application on the wearer's part in many cases, with rose-tinted glasses and hobbyist knowledge doing the rest for some guys to assert that vintage is stronger/better because it had more oakmoss. If you prefer it, then by all means seek vintage out, but people new to Polo Sport will still \"get the point\" with what's commonly out there. Jean Patou took the depth of Polo Sport's base even further with the oakmoss-stuffed Voyageur (1994), a fragrance that isn't even possible to make under current IFRA regulations, so if oakmoss content is important to you, then I'd not look to this scent for satisfaction anyway. Wings for Men by Giorgio Beverly Hills (1994) is the next logical leap for folks who enjoy the \"blueness\" of Polo Sport, as Wings for Men is the \"bluest\" aquatic I have ever smelled. For everyone else, Polo Sport is the once-ubiquitous turning point in men's fragrances where \"sport\" was more of a marketing gimmick than an actual olfactive aesthetic, and remains something that at least needs to be experienced once if not worn or enjoyed alongside Polo Blue (2002), as a critical step towards where mass-appeal masculine perfumes have gone. I still enjoy the occasional sniff from Polo Sport when I find an old tester here or there, but wearing this is like strapping on my JNCO jeans and tossing a Korn CD into my stereo, and I'm not testosterone-filled or close to having pectorals bursting from a purposely too-tight shirt to own a bottle unironically. Still, for the guy looking to rock some old-school aquatics (feels wrong placing those two terms together but here we are), Polo Sport is probably the best starting place because it shares the most DNA with what's out there now than anything else made back then, and still smells pretty damn good too. Just please remember to rack your weights when you're done with them, since not all of us can bench press a SmartCar like you, thanks. Thumbs up. 12th January 2020224892ADVERTISEMENTtinfoilhatdudeShow all reviewsWore this during High School in the mid-late 90's, so I'm used to the vintage formula. Was a great starter for getting into fragrances, but every single person I knew had a bottle and wore it often. 6.5 out of 10, too bad for IFRA regs. I definitely wouldn't care to smell a current formula, and to drop the coin on a vintage bottle? Why bother with so many better vintage choices?To the good 'ol days... 22nd June 2019218062Hugh V.Show all reviews*reformulated version with the clear blue spray nozzle*This opens up much like Calvin Klein's Eternity. It's sharp and sweet, but with a blue smell to it, if that makes sense. And like Eternity, the sharpness in the opening gradually fades away to reveal a much softer interpretation of it. To me, it's somewhat linear, in a good way. I've heard reports that this isn't as good as the Cosmair version. That it even smells bad. I've never tried the original, but the bottle I did sample smelled really nice and pleasant. SMELLS LIKE:Aqua Velva Ice Sport. Almost the exact same, except Polo Sport obviously lasts longer, and has a better dry down. Also, Aqua Quorum. CONCLUSION:I like this scent, but it's not really mature. This feels like something a high schooler would wear. Almost like a starter fragrance.I think Polo Blue, and Polo Blue Sport are both a slightly more serious take on this style, although I think this one is more distinctive.Overall this is a very pleasant scent. It feels a bit dated because it reminds me of Cool Water, and that scent, for me, was synonymous with the early/mid 90s. An excellent fragrance to give you an idea what the 90s was like.26th September 2018207247DEAN jaShow all reviewsVintage formulation by Cosmair is excellent, although its practically impossible to find now.Newer reformulation severely lacks projection and longevity, and the scent disappears completely in a half hour. 13th October 2016177873BuysblindShow all reviewsIf you're going to buy this, try your best to score a vintage bottle from the 90's. I wore this a lot in high school and recently found myself in the mood to wear it again. Lo and behold it smells as good as I remember it smelling. And when you smell a vintage, you're immediately reminded of the superior quality of ingredients that were used in fragrances before all the IFRA restrictions and reformulations (the current version pales in comparison). The average sports fragrance today has none of the complexity or character of this, which although nice and cutting edge, was nothing spectacularly complex in its day. Polo Sport is a tart aquatic, blending fresh fruity notes with a salty, marine/seaweed sort of smell. It mixes sour with salty and sweet to create something reminiscent of coastal breezes, perhaps in cooler, northern climates, as it's certainly not tropical in any way. It's distinct, and despite the plethora of sports fragrance which have been produced since its inception, Polo Sport retains some degree of originality, easy to identify and fairly memorable. While the vintage bottle I use smells great, its longevity may have suffered over time, as it lasts only about 3 or 4 hours before it's gone. I'm not hugely nostalgic about fragrances and rarely yearn for scents of yesteryear, but Polo Sport is one that manages to scatch that itch while also smelling good enough and modern enough to continue wearing today. Give me this, Polo Green, and Cool Water's Lancaster version and I'm pretty much set as far as vintage is concerned. Thumbs up, with a warning to avoid the current formulation in favor of vintage if possible. 4th October 2016177613gdtrfb895Show all reviewsWished they still made this. Yes it is synthetic, but I used to get more compliments on this than any other fragrance. Great frag for the gym applied sparingly. Many aquatics have come after this one but they haven't really improved much. Love the clean pineapple and seaweed notes that smell clean aquatic but not fishy. I think this one just really works with my body chemistry. 4th December 2015165049OCNBreeze7Show all reviewsThe Original Polo Sport... A great fragrance that we will miss... One of the classic fragrance designers, Ralph Lauren, has produced a number of scents we have grown to love. It is too bad that some of these fragrances have run their course and \"put out to pasture\" - so to speak. Polo Sport is one of these fragrances that became a classic, but with time, has become increasingly hard to find. Perhaps it, too, has been discontinued. I recently purchased this fragrance online and could hardly await arrival of the scent that became popular in the mid-90s - as a mid-40s guy (and still roguishly handsome) - I remember this time period fondly... Out of the bottle Polo Sport presents a complexity of notes, but settles into simplicity of citrus, fruity, and \"woodsy\" notes. A classic scent that is breathes clean, fresh, and distinguished. Well done, Mr. Lauren..!! While the longevity and projection/sillage of this new bottle is average, it seems that bottles produced in the late 90s or early 00s, the fragrance lasted longer with greater sillage. There have been comparisons to younger siblings, \"Red, White, and Blue\" and \"Polo Blue Sport\" - I am not sure I get those same notes. Each are great fragrances, but very much different than this blend. Polo Sport has plenty of \"Wow Factor\" (compliments from the opposite sex) potential. The first day I wore this, I did not receive any compliments, but due to it's fresh and clean wake, the potential is there. One of the beauties about Polo Sport is the versatility or flexibility - perhaps tailored more for Spring and Summer, I feel confident the fragrance can be worn any time of year and for any occasion. It also can be a favorite for all ages - those of us who grew up with Polo Sport and the younger audience who want to feel clean and fresh. The bottle is an exceptional and classic design - typical Ralph Lauren.. As mentioned, I purchased this online. That said, the packaging is average at best. I, generally, am not a \"conspiracy theory\" type of guy, but I have pondered the thought of authenticity of this purchase. (I will add the purchase was through a very reputable source..) Regardless, the packaging is average or modest.Speaking of the purchase, Polo Sport can still be found moderately priced. My final tally of Polo Sport is 4.3 stars out of 5. Yes, there may be better fragrances out there - even I have those that rank higher - but Polo Sport is truly a classic fragrance that I enjoy. I highly recommend adding to your collection - or for us 40+ more distinguished gentlemen (and I use that term 'loosely'..), replenishing our cologne cabinet with a new bottle of Polo Sport.The Daily I.M. - The best thing in the world, is the world itself (from one of my favorite movies). Make your life count... 10th April 2014137967delShow all reviewsLight, Pleasant, Fresh and Clean Aquatic I'm typing this review based on my nice memories of Polo Sport: it was the bomb during my college years, and everyone seemed to love it back then, as it smelled fresh, clean, and a little fruity-sweet.   The initial alcohol-y blast projects widely, like the fume is morphing to a hand gently guiding your nose to the wearer. I still remember how it used to turn heads minutes after application. Polo Sport quickly becomes a pleasant aquatic after that.   Polo Sport isn't a bad fragrance, but it is light, so it lacks lasting power. If you really like the scent, make sure to carry a splash mini-bottle and reapply as needed like I did back in college.Pros: Pleasant and a head-turnerCons: Fades quickly 21st May 2013129478sjg3839Show all reviewsGreat scent I use to wear years ago. Aquatic fresh with a touch of citrus. I would actually still purchase a bottle of this today. 3rd October 2012134141DutchSchwagShow all reviewsHarry Fremont's resume certainly needs no introduction; the man who a year later dropped CK One on the masses, was already well ahead of the curve on the aquatic revolution when he came up with Polo Sport. Polo Sport is thick with seaweed throughout, with a nice touch of citrus in the opening before completely giving way to the dominant seaweed note for the rest of the dry-down.Certainly shocks and disorients the uninitiated because it is so different from the standard fragrance. The opening is very think with seaweed and cloying citrus, but after a few moments the ginger creeps into the seaweed and creates a spicier, less projecting dry-down that uses many of the standard Polo elements and notes, which don't seem to be able to assert themselves over the heavy dose of seaweed. Works well with natural skin chemistry, producing a natural, warm and organic scent that wears close to the skin and manages to mask most body odors during physical activity. Given the \"sport\" monicker for that reason, but really this is more of a beach fragrance that resonates strongly with those who have spent an early, misty morning on a Northern Californian or Southern Oregonian pacific shore. This is one of the best souvenirs one can pick up to bring back images of the colder beaches of the northern California coast, wealthy in sea-life and seaweed along its banks. Projection and silage are fairly average, with longevity a bit of an issue, usually under 4-5 hours and wearing very close to the skin. Still, if you can appreciate more organic scents like seaweed, this is an incredibly original and unique extension of using organic notes. Polo Sport is very unique for its time, most likely more than a little inspired by the success of Nautica the year before and the influx of newer, trendier Polo inspired fashion houses taking a large portion of the 20 something crowd. The packaging itself reflects a time when the Ralph Lauren name was more vulnerable and less self-assured, trying to modernize with a new logo to go with its new jeans line, in an attempt to break from its illustrious past and more emphatically, the Baby Boomer generation. Polo Sport was Ralph Lauren's deliberate attempt to capture Generation X. Not refined for formal wear, but a fantastic, casual alternative to the plethora of synthetics on the market, Sport is original, organic and oceanic, like driving along Pacific 1 Highway with the top down on a September morning. A best seller largely because of the Polo name, but the Polo name does still stand for quality fabrics, oils and materials and not taking shortcuts in China. The Pacific Ocean in a bottle. Overall 4/5 (Quality 3.5/Originality 4.75/Projection 2.5/Longevity 2.5/Value 3.0/Scent 4.0) 17th November 2011100775Chuck18293Show all reviewsI remember this fragrance back in the day when it was my signature sent It's fresh and clean and smells like body wash, like a nice and clean showerand it's a little bit floral tooOn my skin this last about 8-10 hours wich is greatBut i Wouldn't buy it again beacause I wore it a lot of time maybe just a 75 mlBut It's a very good fragance i think!And a Machine of Compliments the girls love it!!! 11th August 201078697jcastanoShow all reviewsI never knew too much about Polo fragrances but when I saw this at Marshalls for $25 for a 4.2 oz bottle, I thought, why not get it, it's a good deal. I was expecting something to blow me out of this world since everyone I've ever known has put this on a pedestal but unfortunatley, that wasn't the case. At first, I thought it smelled odd? The seaweed note and citrus notes threw me off and there was something about it that smelled dirty, almost like salty, bitter sweat. I know, it sounds weird but I really got that vibe from it! I hated it at first but after wearing it a few more times after that, I must say it grew on me. I actually love the seaweed note in it now and the salty, bitter sweat vibe I used to get from it is no longer there.The aquatic feel to this fragrance is actually very well done and although very synthetic, the combination of citrus, florals, woods, and musk give it a type of character that truly captures the idea of a fresh water ocean, something that I've yet to smell with any other sport fragrance. It's semi-sweet yet green, but has this animalic aura to it but musk tends to do that, and the aldehydes give it a clean, very fresh touch that might even give of the impression of laundry detergent. This fragrance is excellent if you want something different from all the usual aquatic/sport colognes for men out there. I can't imagine why this wasn't so groundbreaking when it first arrived on the scene back in the early 90's. I just imagine myself running on a beach on a warm, sunny day, when all the sudden, a light breeze picks up and freshens the air while it wafts the smell of the deep blue sea all throughout . It's a scent that's great for spring/summer. Its sillage and longevity is fantastic, and uniqueness is a most definite A+! The one thing that this fragrance lacks is in its versatility, but not by much. I wouldn't recommend wearing this in a suit and tie or in any formal attire like one can with most other sport frags (Allure Sport, Dior Sport) because it lacks that \"sophistication\" factor, but if you're the casual type of guy in a t-shirt and jeans or shorts, this is perfect! Overall rating in my book, B+ 8th April 201091536aktp-iciookShow all reviewsHighly masculine in a fresh, aquatic and sporty sense.Sea weed note in Polo Sport is so unique and really fascinating to me.Cheers, 11th February 201071706D.SpradShow all reviewsThis one brings back memories of a trip to Virginia Beach a few years ago. The seaweed in this one must bring me back to that one.I enjoy the memories, and the scent itself isn't too bad, really!I'm never put off by the seaweed, and those I know (both male and female) haven't been either.The opening, like DiamondFlame said, is a jolt many times, and the dry-down is pleasant and semi-sweet.Don't be fooled by the \"Sport\" in Polo Sport. I know plenty of \"Sport\" and \"Fresh\" fragrances that really are just awful have been floating out there for a while, but this one is worth a try, really! 21st November 200974061smellofvictoryShow all reviewsvery unique fresh scent...similar to Cool Water yet very different. Liked this since I was in junior high. 20th September 200972958DiamondflameShow all reviewsI grew up near the sea so I know the smell of seaweed; it is essentially briny but probably too subtle to have that much of an impact on a fragrance. In any case Ralph Lauren's website only mentions a 'sea breeze' accord which instantly made me think of Ferragamo's Subtil, just not POLO SPORT. For me, this scent opens with an effervescent, alcohol-fueled sucker punch which jolts you awake before settling down to a sweet somewhat boozy miasma of 'cucumber and melon', to my nose at least, without relying on cheat sheets. I know fresh aquatics get little love around here but this one gets mine; I finished 2 bottles of the juice! So if you're sick of yours, be a sport, send them my way. And remind me again why Cool Water finished second best in the early '90s. 18th September 200970342MrFragranceReviewShow all reviewsI was very apprehensive about buying this cologne because it smelled very mediocre at first but strangely had a unique note to it. I purchased it more for the fact that my girlfriend LOVES it. It's a deep seaweed smell that tries to be fresh and slightly citrusy. No notes really stand out too much and I like that. The more I wear the more I appreciate it. It's a fantastic gym scent just don't over do it. If applied well this smell is gorgeous and well done. The problem is, it's a younger scent typically and young guys tend to over apply so there are many negative associations with this fragrance. I can see why she likes it so much and I can see why so many women feel the same way. It's typically used as a gym scent and guys wearing very casual white t-shirts, shorts and working hard and getting sweaty. They associate that with this smell and they find it sexy. 1st September 200971863CougartownShow all reviewsMinty, bright, fresh, and very strong. Exactly what the tried to do, most likely. Old school, high schooler appropriate, but very good. 5th June 200969576MFJShow all reviewsI find Polo Sport to be very much in the same vein as Cool Water and Eternity, both of which, I thoroughly enjoy. There is a clean, minty-fresh vibe to Polo Sport that is rather uplifting and invigorating. I get a nice leafy aroma as well. Well popular in the 90s, and for good reasons. It does seemed designed to evoke the imagery of \"fresh masculinity\". 18th May 200956631AdamaShow all reviewsMy first frag, chosen by my girlfriend because of its inoffensive nature. Strong, fresh opening. Seaweed is really dominant; very salty and unique. Reminds me heavily of an ocean breeze, but there's something that is just a bit off that ruins the illusion.It calms down after the first few minutes and moves quickly into a barely detectable woody musk.I use this stuff for the gym now, since A) It smells nicer when you're working out and B) I don't like it as much as my other frags. For $75, you can find cheaper gym-frags.Edit: I've been going back and re-reviewing my old reviews. Polo Sport was my first cologne, and I've yet to find an Aquatic better than it, despite my searching. Sport is a perfect blend that not only exemplifies the Aquatic genre, but also uses the Seaweed note in a way that is tremendously pleasant.Salty and watery, Sport is still the best at what it does 21 years after it hit the market.Changed from a Neutral to a Thumbs Up, which I should have done years ago. 14th October 2008135368NoraedShow all reviewsFresh, cool and clean scent. It is an Aromatic - Rustic type of perfume. Smells, like lemon, mint, musk and other refreshing notes I cannot describe. I don't know why, but it reminds me of shiny silver and waterfalls. My husband has it. I like it, but he does not think it is special. 27th April 200853410wingerShow all reviewsI can sum this fragrence up in 1 word. CLASSIC. I need say no more!!! 9th January 200849820HampShow all reviewsNice fresh scent. Not sickening sweet like Cool Water. Much better sillage than Polo Blue. Suitable for daytime or evening wear.

Reminds me of starting work/college and going to pubs for the very first time. It had a shower fresh smell to it and I remember it being rather cloying. Not sure what it smells like these days?? 15th November 2017193965ADVERTISEMENTWay Off ScenterShow all reviewsGenre: FougèreIt's blue, it says sport on the bottle, and, surprise, it's a fresh, fruity-aquatic fougère. What were you expecting  Knize Ten? Heaven knows the world needs more fragrances like this  but only if we find a way to make their fumes fuel an automobile or a city bus. Attempting pineapple in lieu of the usual apple, Polo Sport is on the tart side as its ilk goes, which might make the industrial chemical aquatic accord more tolerable than elsewhere. But only by degree. In my book Polo Sport is no more or less superfluous than any other blue fragrance for men, and guys who want something of this sort will get what they expect from it. I only wonder why they would want it?23rd June 2014144310dallasfanShow all reviewsIt's a good clean scent, smells like a good shower, good office/school scent I have a few samples, i won't by the bottle though, because there are other similar scents out there, and because it's polo it's too expensive for something thats only decent. If i saw a bottle in the store for like $20-$25 I might think about it if i have the extra money. If you can find it for cheap, and you're relatively new with fragrances i'd reccomend it, but otherwise i wouldn't, it's nice but not worth $40Pros: Smells nice and it's lightCons: Doesn't project too well and doesn't very long\" 17th August 2013131106emad91Show all reviewsA Good Cologne For Daily Use. I bought it last night...i just love the fragrance. Those sweet woody citrus notes. Its good for daily rough use and for winters i would say as colognes lasts a lil longer in winters. One can use it in summers too but just for a rough daily use. It fades very quickly.Pros: Smells lovely.Cons: Projection and Sillage not as expected.\" 13th August 2013131016DarvantShow all reviewsThe infamous range of the aquatics is not  my favourite genre of fragrances although i don't abhor those aprioristically just for their provenance and placing.  I have to admit that some woodsy-aquatics or aromatic-ozonic fougere and oceanic kind of watery fragrances surprised me a lot and i don't dislike for sure fragrances as Kenzo Pour Homme, Bvlgari Aqua, Sel de Vetiver The Different Company, Aqua Quorum Puig, the wonderful Horizon Laroche or New West For Him by Aramis. I use to appreciate that rare sense of silvan, aromatic (mint, artemisia, verbena, thyme etc), exotic, airy, naturally and deeply oceanic  freshness in the world of scents and many (aquatics or not) manage to satisfy this feel for sure. I use on the contrary to fully dislike the chemics and the metal, i mean the excessively detergent-fruity-floral ozonic scents (like L'Eau D'Issey which anyway has its qualities), the  soapy-chemical-detergent like shower foams (Blu Pour Homme , Heaven Chopard), the metallic (Echo Davidoff, Chrome Azzaro, Chrome Legend, DKNY Men, Acqua di Gio' Pour Homme etc), the sparkling-energizing sporty kind of aquatics (Allure Sport Chanel, Byblos Uomo, Burberry Sport Men, etc., etc., etc.). Polo Sport (i swear i'm not misleaded just by the name) takes unfortunately part of this family (with its uncompromisingly aquatic,watermelon kind, orangy accord of seaweeds, citrus, pineapple and musk) together with dozens of Byblos, Boss, Armani, Miyake, Dolce &Gabbana, Bvlgari and going on till the end of the world, out there. Slightly better Cool Water Davidoff with  its less chemical feel, its better equipped balance and its touch of aromatic woodsy feel. The note of ginger (Bvlgari Blue, Byblos Uomo etc.) uses to imprint  that sort of cool and detergent spark that makes me thinking to a shower gel and not to a real well structured fragrance, so Polo Sport does and the final \"sporty-deodorant-detergent\" feel surpasses sense of elegance and virile sharp sophistication. Good shower and after shower with Polo Sport my friends. 30th December 2011133051colormechrisShow all reviewsWell, Polo Sport has a soft spot in my heart because I worked at the Polo store on Rodeo Drive when it first came out. That was an experience, and the smell of PSport brings it all back. Ralph himself even came in once with his wife and they just kind of stood around watching. Or were they sniffing? Cool Water had come out in 1988 but was just reaching the height of its popularity. Mr. Lauren, no dummy, knew a good thing when he smelled it. Thus Polo Sport was born. Let's not use the phrase \"rip off\". Ralph would never do that! But to say Polo Sport wasn't a direct descendent of Cool Water wouldn't be true either.The place was infused with the stuff. It was at every register. Perhaps I associate the cologne with clothing so the next logical step is laundry detergent. And it still smells that way to me. Like a big bottle of ALL or FAB or something. That's not neccessarily bad; but scented laundry detergent isn't exactly the height of olfactory finesse. And Polo Sport has about as much finesse as a box of Tide. But still...It has a certain fun, uplifting appeal to it, much like Clinique Happy. The fruit here, however, is not the ever dependable orange, but pineapple. Mixed with a ton of apparent aldehydes, the entire effect is sort of a CGI of Waikiki Beach. A \"seaweed\" note is said to be in each phase of the perfume, but nothing in there smells like seaweed to me. Seaweed is salty and earthy smelling. Polo Sport is sweet from start to finish.To sum, it's a great no-brainer for hot weather and hanging out at the beach, the lake, the pool...but go easy. It can annoy worse than a bratty teen-ager, and has about as much depth. But it can make you smile too. 30th January 201183979urflinessShow all reviewsI don't get what all the flak is about.I agree there is nothing spectacular about this fragrance. However in my opinion there is nothing that smells worse than Dior Farenheit.give polo sport a break.Trust me there is worse out there. 12th April 201066478micciShow all reviewsOne of those fresh, safe frags...not very creative but I don't think it's too generic either as far as the 'aqua-blue' bit goes....There is something earthy about the dry down that sets it apart...It definitely tops it's league so go ahead and grab one for yourself. 27th January 201044533ScentaurShow all reviewsIt really is suitable for sport or gym wear. The impact of this scent is better during the 90s. If you're feeling nostalgic, then go help yourself with this one. Old school but still kicking. 10th January 200965534Tony TShow all reviewsone of the best sellers of all time. me being 28 years young have received this fragrance 3 christmas's in my younger days.a bit fruity and synthetic but still a classic up their with cool water. i have a bottle now that i spray around the house every now and then. great first timer's scent but the fragrance world has created better since 1993.go obama!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 6th November 200853639bryan the rockerShow all reviewsthis smells sweet and synthetically minty, fresh,its a sport fragrance that hides the smell and acidity of sweat, good for active people, not offensive, but nothing to write home about, rating, just average, 10th September 200855330ToughCoolShow all reviewsI remember this as being \"fresher.\" A recent sniff back in time of this had me thinking the pineapple and seaweed together was some sort of bad maple syrup concoction. It finally leveled out and some of the freshness I enjoyed was there but I still kept getting that maple syrup smell in between that turned me off. 2nd September 200856198AndrewthecologneguyShow all reviewsI have never held seaweed up to my nose to see what it smells like, but I guess that 'weired' initially burst from Polo sport is it. I bought this because i like the bottle and I remember a friend having this back in college and it was quite different. It reminds me of a sample of Nautica Competition (blue bottle) that I got and threw away because it was just awful, except Polo Sport doesn't possess the 'gasoline' accord in the Nautica. I saw a relaunch of the Nautica later (yellow packaging) and I guess they realized how bad the initial smelled or more likely that Polo Sport was on the money and the Nautica wasn't. Definately not for everybody, but something to tickle your nose if you don't want to wear anything else (does that make sense?) 31st July 200733860deepthoughtShow all reviewsI am currently swimming in a sea of seaweed, which isn't so surprising considering I have just sprayed myself with RL Sport. I just can't get my nose to dig out the 'fresh' notes in it. I'm sure this has certain applications where it works (see previous reviews) but I'm not into sailing ;) 11th September 20064690woodbaneShow all reviewsHow is it possible for a frag to have seaweed as top, middle and base notes? Because it's probably made from it, that's how!!!Long considered the 'athletes classic' this fragrance is a typical locker room smell that can be harsh on the nose, especially when combined with sweat. Wear it lightly with linen pants, a cotton shirt and sandals doen at the marina and you might be surprised how good it can be. 5th May 200624996QuietEarthShow all reviewsIt just occurred to me that if this were a movie, it would be a light, fluffy, pointless Hollywood Romantic Comedy with Julia Roberts and/or Matthew McConnachy. It's a perfectly nice smell, but there's no depth to it, no complexity. It's oh-so-slightly tangier or sharper than Polo Blue but still, after the initial \"hmm that's interesting\", there's no more interest. Don't get me wrong - it's better than Eau de cigarette, but it never really gets past the peachy-keen, All-American, Star & Stripes, apple-pie cotton-candy veneer that is on the surface. Which is a shame. I expected more from Ralph Lauren. Oh, and it really doesn't last all that long, and it's hard pressed to make it's present felt after about an hour or so. Again, I own this particular \"Polo\" but come on, Ralph, you're letting me down! I'm expecting something better from that name! 4th May 200624837scenteur7Show all reviewsReally not bad - considering when it was launched. It smells great on my dad, but definitely not for me...and is it just me or does Polo Blue smell strikingly similar? 16th January 200620253dymitchellShow all reviewsIt's a good beginner's fragrance. It's a pleasant but shallow scent that gets old very quickly. 10th December 20055066MonkeyManMattShow all reviewsThe first \"real\" fragrance I ever bought and I remember being amazed how anything could smell this complex. 12 years and some 50 different bottles of fragrance later that thought seems somewhat remote...Sentimental associations aside Polo Sport is a decent release which is indeed very sporty. Somewhat similar to Kenzo PH, but inferior in quality. It is a citrussy, aquatic fragrance with a peppery bite and clear seaweed notes.Not bad at all, but so many more exciting things have come out since then. Will always hold nostalgic value for me though ;). 8th August 200514996Most reviews in the last weekmanlyscents (8)Colbourne (8)Varanis Ridari (4)landshark321 (3)exmin (3)speedracer (3)RoamingRose (3)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)SPACEDOUT (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (28)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (8)Lian (7)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

He gave the scent four stars, calling it a \"lavender pineapple.\"I think the original Polo is offensive enough. The addition of this even worse off-shoot does the reputation of the original no good. To my nose this is a very dry, green and sharp scent and the pineapple is just stupid, only making things worse.The scent is just plain bad, as was its namesake. 2nd October 2015162493drseidShow all reviewsA very disappointing generic smelling scent from Polo. It was as if RL tries to please everyone and instead pleases none fully. I don't get any originality here at all, and if this fragrance-by-poll scent is going to smell similar to every other \"sport\" scent, why bother? Pass on this one. 2 stars out of 5. 21st August 2011121868MOONBShow all reviewsCalone and cucumber notes . . . what's not to hate? Polo Sport is a fragrance I reviewed a while ago here on basenotes, but my words somehow got lost. Let me restate them: this fragrance is mediocre from start to finish, and it's not because it's a fruity aquatic fresh fougere. I can forgive the hundreds of entries in that genre if they each offer something distinctive to it. But that's a fantastic standard. Simply put, Polo Sport offers nothing. The tangerine and accompanying citruses are a chemical byproduct of whatever form of calone was used, a fact that becomes painfully obvious the longer you wear Polo. They never really fade, but just hang in there til the end. Then there's the middle, which is quite \"cool\" feeling. Like cucumbers on your eyes, this phase braces your nose, and is perhaps the only thing about the fragrance that feels good to me. Rapidly the coolness sullies into a faded version of itself, detached and marred by some pointlessly-integrated oakmoss and a vague suggestion of green herbs. Yes, Polo Sport is clearly an agent of freshness with plenty of practical utility in the gym locker room. Beyond that, it doesn't register as a serious fragrance, and is to be avoided. Unless, of course, you wish to remain inconspicuous, in which case I would say Polo Sport is your Holy Grail. 30th April 201190614brrrryShow all reviewsI loved this back in the mid 90's. I revisited it this weekend, passing time in Ulta while my GF shopped, just for the hell of it. I really don't understand it at all. I guess it made sense when I was a 17-18 year old kid. But now at 32 I just don't get it. It didn't smell sporty to me at all. I just got a general \"spice\" smell out of it and it was terribly synthetic. Not to mention, extremely overbearing. The fact that there are so many other \"sporty\" frags out there makes Polo Sport expendable and IMO not worth sampling. 2nd February 201056390JackisblackShow all reviewsNasty. I like me some polo, but I don't like generic saline blasts. 30th September 200972780latkanShow all reviewsFor some reason i had remembered this as a great smelling frag. So when i was able to find it in my local perfume sttore i did not hesistate to buy it, a BIG mistake that was. Not only that it was the 125ml bottle so i wasted the most amount of money possible on it! It is very synthetic and smells like (agreeing with machineo) dirty socks. Lasting power, well lets just say this is not a war of atrition otherwise it would be over v v quikly!Waste of time and money completely disgusted now im left with a frag so rubbish to give to my friends [they'll think i playin a prank of some sort].

Way too much alcohol and very synthetic smelling.Why Ralph Lauren would discontinue Monogram and launch this venom is beyond me. Seaweed extract?! Are you kidding me?!This smells like glorified cough syrup!I got this bottle from someone in the industry and it's one of the few fragrances that I hated so much I gave it away. Big disappointment from Ralph Lauren. 14th May 200946546bosati05Show all reviewsI Got some for Christmas. Let's just say it wasn't a good christmas. 7th January 200965264ShaheenShow all reviewsCheap \"sport scent\" stick deodorant mixed with seaweed and pineapple juice? Um...I'm confused. Why would anyone like that?I just couldn't bear to wait for the dry-down on this one, so I guess it is possible that the base notes smell quite different than the top and middle notes (although highly implausible). Unless you want to reek around the office, quickly pass this one by. 24th August 200859190SirSlartyShow all reviewsSmells like the maki used to wrap sushi rolls and dipped in pineapple juice. This is what started all the sporty junk that everyone else seems to copy. Though a classic (?) it didn't age well. Awful to my nose. 9th August 200848010thatsmr2usirShow all reviewsThis is such a terrible fragrance. The tops notes are to strong & not pleasing at all. I suppose it is the seaweed! Luckily I got this as a gift & sprayed it once and then passed it on.. The other person did not like the stinch so they just tossed it! I would not recommend this to anyone. 13th April 200849922HeidiShow all reviewsBought this a couple of years ago, since I liked it on a paper in the store.

Smells rancid, like old perfume, no sport at all... . 7th December 200633097FragranceFan255Show all reviewsOn first use Polo Sport brought to mind one horrible olfactory image native to me here in the Old South. Freshy tobacco 'juice'. To my nose someone just as well had spit a wad upon my wrist. After the top notes died down I did start to smell something that was akin to Cool Water. Well, Cool Water and tobacco 'juice'. I'll stick to the Cool Water for this fix, Mr. Lauren. 27th July 20068360zenpiperShow all reviewsAwful.

I’ve had the same bottle since around 2001 (the Cosmair version) I don’t know why, but I’ve never used this on my wrist until recently. I ended up getting some really pleasant palo santo woody notes that I never got from my neck. This is the most active scent I own, in that it changes and moves throughout the day. It feels alive, like it will politely step aside and allow me to enjoy other scents when they show up. It has some spicy ambery notes that end up smelling of maple syrup on my neck. I adore this cologne.

Bon appetit! 0 stars. 15th September 2020233816Varanis RidariShow all reviewsPolo Sport by Ralph Lauren (1993) was a very big deal when it launched, and became the go-to scent for many a \"gym bro\" back in the day, who were composed entirely of muscle, libido, and a desire to beat everyone at everything in which one could possibly declare a winner and loser. This was the smell of unbridled ego-driven whey-fueled insecurity for much of the 90's, a market that would be tapped into heavily until the 2000's, and if you so dare as got even unintentionally in the path of one such meathead doused in Polo Sport on his way in or out the door, you'd be on the receiving end of either an arrogant quip or possibly a shiner. Now not everyone wearing Polo Sport is or was a self-centered \"Chad\", as a lot of impressionable teenage boys and young men throughout the time Polo Sport reigned supreme wore it to be \"on trend\", much in the same way Davidoff Cool Water (1988) was also worn to absolute death. For my experience, this was one of the few scents you were almost required to own if you were going to own any at all coming up through high school by the end of the decade, as wearing something so popular that onlookers could recognize your scent was actually encouraged rather than frowned upon like it seems to be now. Polo Sport wasn't so much an important release for incidentally becoming the territorial pissings of steroid abusers during the 90's, but rather because it furthered the aquatic genre put into being by the aforementioned Cool Water and eventually the \"blue fragrance\" category. There were other attempts at emulating the accord founded by the erstwhile Davidoff mega-hit, but nobody really tried to advance the state of the art quite like Harry Freemont did with Polo Sport. Becoming the number-one \"sports scent\" among males for a time is no small feat, but the combination of oceanic tones with a richer earthy/woody underpinning was one sure-fire way to make it happen. Polo Sport is by far the final word in \"blue\" aquatics, and there would be at least one or two more great leaps in the genre until it lay dormant to be reawakened without so much \"blue\" midway through the 2000's, but it's still pretty important because the abstract concept of a fruity fresh \"blue\" masculine fragrance really solidified with Polo Sport, evolving more when Bleu de Chanel (2010) showed up to change the game by removing the aquatic elements. The cobalt-colored bottle reminiscent of a sports canteen is crowned with a cap and resembling a bar/knob from a free weight or piece of athletic equipment, housing a juice that itself would be copied countless times for the next 15 years or so. Polo Sport fused fruity minty top notes with smooth cool spices and a unique sea grass note in the heart, then finished with a woody aromatic base laced with the prerequisite dihydromyrcenol \"aquatic\" note. Opening with mandarin, tangerine, pineapple, mint, lavender and neroli, Polo Sport confronts you with a dynamic contrast of fruity sweet, cool, sharply citric, slightly-medicinal aura that sets up for the green vegetal sea grass heart mixed with geranium and rosewood. This heart is the most-iconic feature of Polo Sport, and is the part that would become most-copied as the 90's went on, quickly stealing the title of \"aquatic gold standard\" away from Cool Water, which itself has by comparison received far fewer clones over the years. From there, we move into a more-conventional base of musk, oakmoss, patchouli, and sandalwood with the \"aquatic\" note moving between them, but this is also a bit unconventional in a way too, because it was far heavier and more aromatic than what few aquatics arrived on the scene prior, and definitely has more depth than Cool Water itself. What we're left with is an accord that provides a semi-sweet fresh crisp experience with dynamism up top mixed with a vegetal quality of the heart that very gradually moves the slider into aromatic woods and musk territory as the base takes over. Polo Sport is a suprisingly unpretentious fragrance since it offers up approachable freshness and inviting warmth when you get close, which seems all the more ironic that it was pitched as a sport scent and worn by a bunch of Gold's Gym flunkies looking to get in everyone's pants or scare them off the dance floor with arms too big to do much more than the cabbage patch when C&C Music Factory started cranking at the Roxbury. Where you would use this now is anyone's guess, as Polo Sport has moved so far away from the common masculine vernacular that wearing it around millennials might actually catch people off-guard regardless of context or time of year, but this feels more summery than anything else even if it has enough weight for general use. You won't get looks of concern like you might wearing an 80's powerhouse or 70's aromatic, but you'd definitely get some folks trying to place where they've smelled it before if you sport it on an outing.As for performance, conflicting opinions exist about pre-and-post-2011 batches, or before and after oakmoss was heavily restricted and mostly replaced with evernyl for the houses unwilling to pay up on the low-atranol treated oakmoss available nowadays. For my part, the modern version of Polo Sport still \"smells like Polo Sport\", and wears with moderate projection and longevity. This was never a \"beast-mode\" fragrance from the onset, but most people experiencing Polo Sport back in its prime were also experiencing an over-application on the wearer's part in many cases, with rose-tinted glasses and hobbyist knowledge doing the rest for some guys to assert that vintage is stronger/better because it had more oakmoss. If you prefer it, then by all means seek vintage out, but people new to Polo Sport will still \"get the point\" with what's commonly out there. Jean Patou took the depth of Polo Sport's base even further with the oakmoss-stuffed Voyageur (1994), a fragrance that isn't even possible to make under current IFRA regulations, so if oakmoss content is important to you, then I'd not look to this scent for satisfaction anyway. Wings for Men by Giorgio Beverly Hills (1994) is the next logical leap for folks who enjoy the \"blueness\" of Polo Sport, as Wings for Men is the \"bluest\" aquatic I have ever smelled. For everyone else, Polo Sport is the once-ubiquitous turning point in men's fragrances where \"sport\" was more of a marketing gimmick than an actual olfactive aesthetic, and remains something that at least needs to be experienced once if not worn or enjoyed alongside Polo Blue (2002), as a critical step towards where mass-appeal masculine perfumes have gone. I still enjoy the occasional sniff from Polo Sport when I find an old tester here or there, but wearing this is like strapping on my JNCO jeans and tossing a Korn CD into my stereo, and I'm not testosterone-filled or close to having pectorals bursting from a purposely too-tight shirt to own a bottle unironically. Still, for the guy looking to rock some old-school aquatics (feels wrong placing those two terms together but here we are), Polo Sport is probably the best starting place because it shares the most DNA with what's out there now than anything else made back then, and still smells pretty damn good too. Just please remember to rack your weights when you're done with them, since not all of us can bench press a SmartCar like you, thanks. Thumbs up. 12th January 2020224892tinfoilhatdudeShow all reviewsWore this during High School in the mid-late 90's, so I'm used to the vintage formula. Was a great starter for getting into fragrances, but every single person I knew had a bottle and wore it often. 6.5 out of 10, too bad for IFRA regs. I definitely wouldn't care to smell a current formula, and to drop the coin on a vintage bottle? Why bother with so many better vintage choices?To the good 'ol days... 22nd June 2019218062Hugh V.Show all reviews*reformulated version with the clear blue spray nozzle*This opens up much like Calvin Klein's Eternity. It's sharp and sweet, but with a blue smell to it, if that makes sense. And like Eternity, the sharpness in the opening gradually fades away to reveal a much softer interpretation of it. To me, it's somewhat linear, in a good way. I've heard reports that this isn't as good as the Cosmair version. That it even smells bad. I've never tried the original, but the bottle I did sample smelled really nice and pleasant. SMELLS LIKE:Aqua Velva Ice Sport. Almost the exact same, except Polo Sport obviously lasts longer, and has a better dry down. Also, Aqua Quorum. CONCLUSION:I like this scent, but it's not really mature. This feels like something a high schooler would wear. Almost like a starter fragrance.I think Polo Blue, and Polo Blue Sport are both a slightly more serious take on this style, although I think this one is more distinctive.Overall this is a very pleasant scent. It feels a bit dated because it reminds me of Cool Water, and that scent, for me, was synonymous with the early/mid 90s. An excellent fragrance to give you an idea what the 90s was like.26th September 2018207247vipersinthefieldShow all reviewsNothing special about Polo Sport.Half aquatic and half fruity fresh 'sporty' scent.It's clean and fresh...it's just boring yet expensive.You could probably blend Nautica Classic and any Adidas fragrance with it and make your own little 'mongrel' of a scent that would be more creative. 14th March 2018199009Man Of The WorldShow all reviewsBought this when it first came out!! Reminds me of starting work/college and going to pubs for the very first time. It had a shower fresh smell to it and I remember it being rather cloying. Not sure what it smells like these days?? 15th November 2017193965DEAN jaShow all reviewsVintage formulation by Cosmair is excellent, although its practically impossible to find now.Newer reformulation severely lacks projection and longevity, and the scent disappears completely in a half hour. 13th October 2016177873BuysblindShow all reviewsIf you're going to buy this, try your best to score a vintage bottle from the 90's. I wore this a lot in high school and recently found myself in the mood to wear it again. Lo and behold it smells as good as I remember it smelling. And when you smell a vintage, you're immediately reminded of the superior quality of ingredients that were used in fragrances before all the IFRA restrictions and reformulations (the current version pales in comparison). The average sports fragrance today has none of the complexity or character of this, which although nice and cutting edge, was nothing spectacularly complex in its day. Polo Sport is a tart aquatic, blending fresh fruity notes with a salty, marine/seaweed sort of smell. It mixes sour with salty and sweet to create something reminiscent of coastal breezes, perhaps in cooler, northern climates, as it's certainly not tropical in any way. It's distinct, and despite the plethora of sports fragrance which have been produced since its inception, Polo Sport retains some degree of originality, easy to identify and fairly memorable. While the vintage bottle I use smells great, its longevity may have suffered over time, as it lasts only about 3 or 4 hours before it's gone. I'm not hugely nostalgic about fragrances and rarely yearn for scents of yesteryear, but Polo Sport is one that manages to scatch that itch while also smelling good enough and modern enough to continue wearing today. Give me this, Polo Green, and Cool Water's Lancaster version and I'm pretty much set as far as vintage is concerned. Thumbs up, with a warning to avoid the current formulation in favor of vintage if possible. 4th October 2016177613gdtrfb895Show all reviewsWished they still made this. Yes it is synthetic, but I used to get more compliments on this than any other fragrance. Great frag for the gym applied sparingly. Many aquatics have come after this one but they haven't really improved much. Love the clean pineapple and seaweed notes that smell clean aquatic but not fishy. I think this one just really works with my body chemistry. 4th December 2015165049JackTwistShow all reviewsLuca Turin thinks the \"sweet and sour pineapple\" in this variation of the original Polo is a good thing. He gave the scent four stars, calling it a \"lavender pineapple.\"I think the original Polo is offensive enough. The addition of this even worse off-shoot does the reputation of the original no good. To my nose this is a very dry, green and sharp scent and the pineapple is just stupid, only making things worse.The scent is just plain bad, as was its namesake. 2nd October 2015162493Way Off ScenterShow all reviewsGenre: FougèreIt's blue, it says sport on the bottle, and, surprise, it's a fresh, fruity-aquatic fougère. What were you expecting  Knize Ten? Heaven knows the world needs more fragrances like this  but only if we find a way to make their fumes fuel an automobile or a city bus. Attempting pineapple in lieu of the usual apple, Polo Sport is on the tart side as its ilk goes, which might make the industrial chemical aquatic accord more tolerable than elsewhere. But only by degree. In my book Polo Sport is no more or less superfluous than any other blue fragrance for men, and guys who want something of this sort will get what they expect from it. I only wonder why they would want it?23rd June 2014144310OCNBreeze7Show all reviewsThe Original Polo Sport... A great fragrance that we will miss... One of the classic fragrance designers, Ralph Lauren, has produced a number of scents we have grown to love. It is too bad that some of these fragrances have run their course and \"put out to pasture\" - so to speak. Polo Sport is one of these fragrances that became a classic, but with time, has become increasingly hard to find. Perhaps it, too, has been discontinued. I recently purchased this fragrance online and could hardly await arrival of the scent that became popular in the mid-90s - as a mid-40s guy (and still roguishly handsome) - I remember this time period fondly... Out of the bottle Polo Sport presents a complexity of notes, but settles into simplicity of citrus, fruity, and \"woodsy\" notes. A classic scent that is breathes clean, fresh, and distinguished. Well done, Mr. Lauren..!! While the longevity and projection/sillage of this new bottle is average, it seems that bottles produced in the late 90s or early 00s, the fragrance lasted longer with greater sillage. There have been comparisons to younger siblings, \"Red, White, and Blue\" and \"Polo Blue Sport\" - I am not sure I get those same notes. Each are great fragrances, but very much different than this blend. Polo Sport has plenty of \"Wow Factor\" (compliments from the opposite sex) potential. The first day I wore this, I did not receive any compliments, but due to it's fresh and clean wake, the potential is there. One of the beauties about Polo Sport is the versatility or flexibility - perhaps tailored more for Spring and Summer, I feel confident the fragrance can be worn any time of year and for any occasion. It also can be a favorite for all ages - those of us who grew up with Polo Sport and the younger audience who want to feel clean and fresh. The bottle is an exceptional and classic design - typical Ralph Lauren.. As mentioned, I purchased this online. That said, the packaging is average at best. I, generally, am not a \"conspiracy theory\" type of guy, but I have pondered the thought of authenticity of this purchase. (I will add the purchase was through a very reputable source..) Regardless, the packaging is average or modest.Speaking of the purchase, Polo Sport can still be found moderately priced. My final tally of Polo Sport is 4.3 stars out of 5. Yes, there may be better fragrances out there - even I have those that rank higher - but Polo Sport is truly a classic fragrance that I enjoy. I highly recommend adding to your collection - or for us 40+ more distinguished gentlemen (and I use that term 'loosely'..), replenishing our cologne cabinet with a new bottle of Polo Sport.The Daily I.M. - The best thing in the world, is the world itself (from one of my favorite movies). Make your life count... 10th April 2014137967dallasfanShow all reviewsIt's a good clean scent, smells like a good shower, good office/school scent I have a few samples, i won't by the bottle though, because there are other similar scents out there, and because it's polo it's too expensive for something thats only decent. If i saw a bottle in the store for like $20-$25 I might think about it if i have the extra money. If you can find it for cheap, and you're relatively new with fragrances i'd reccomend it, but otherwise i wouldn't, it's nice but not worth $40Pros: Smells nice and it's lightCons: Doesn't project too well and doesn't very long\" 17th August 2013131106emad91Show all reviewsA Good Cologne For Daily Use.

I still remember how it used to turn heads minutes after application. Polo Sport quickly becomes a pleasant aquatic after that.   Polo Sport isn't a bad fragrance, but it is light, so it lacks lasting power. If you really like the scent, make sure to carry a splash mini-bottle and reapply as needed like I did back in college.Pros: Pleasant and a head-turnerCons: Fades quickly 21st May 2013129478sjg3839Show all reviewsGreat scent I use to wear years ago. Aquatic fresh with a touch of citrus. I would actually still purchase a bottle of this today. 3rd October 2012134141DarvantShow all reviewsThe infamous range of the aquatics is not  my favourite genre of fragrances although i don't abhor those aprioristically just for their provenance and placing.  I have to admit that some woodsy-aquatics or aromatic-ozonic fougere and oceanic kind of watery fragrances surprised me a lot and i don't dislike for sure fragrances as Kenzo Pour Homme, Bvlgari Aqua, Sel de Vetiver The Different Company, Aqua Quorum Puig, the wonderful Horizon Laroche or New West For Him by Aramis. I use to appreciate that rare sense of silvan, aromatic (mint, artemisia, verbena, thyme etc), exotic, airy, naturally and deeply oceanic  freshness in the world of scents and many (aquatics or not) manage to satisfy this feel for sure. I use on the contrary to fully dislike the chemics and the metal, i mean the excessively detergent-fruity-floral ozonic scents (like L'Eau D'Issey which anyway has its qualities), the  soapy-chemical-detergent like shower foams (Blu Pour Homme , Heaven Chopard), the metallic (Echo Davidoff, Chrome Azzaro, Chrome Legend, DKNY Men, Acqua di Gio' Pour Homme etc), the sparkling-energizing sporty kind of aquatics (Allure Sport Chanel, Byblos Uomo, Burberry Sport Men, etc., etc., etc.). Polo Sport (i swear i'm not misleaded just by the name) takes unfortunately part of this family (with its uncompromisingly aquatic,watermelon kind, orangy accord of seaweeds, citrus, pineapple and musk) together with dozens of Byblos, Boss, Armani, Miyake, Dolce &Gabbana, Bvlgari and going on till the end of the world, out there. Slightly better Cool Water Davidoff with  its less chemical feel, its better equipped balance and its touch of aromatic woodsy feel. The note of ginger (Bvlgari Blue, Byblos Uomo etc.) uses to imprint  that sort of cool and detergent spark that makes me thinking to a shower gel and not to a real well structured fragrance, so Polo Sport does and the final \"sporty-deodorant-detergent\" feel surpasses sense of elegance and virile sharp sophistication. Good shower and after shower with Polo Sport my friends. 30th December 2011133051DutchSchwagShow all reviewsHarry Fremont's resume certainly needs no introduction; the man who a year later dropped CK One on the masses, was already well ahead of the curve on the aquatic revolution when he came up with Polo Sport. Polo Sport is thick with seaweed throughout, with a nice touch of citrus in the opening before completely giving way to the dominant seaweed note for the rest of the dry-down.Certainly shocks and disorients the uninitiated because it is so different from the standard fragrance. The opening is very think with seaweed and cloying citrus, but after a few moments the ginger creeps into the seaweed and creates a spicier, less projecting dry-down that uses many of the standard Polo elements and notes, which don't seem to be able to assert themselves over the heavy dose of seaweed. Works well with natural skin chemistry, producing a natural, warm and organic scent that wears close to the skin and manages to mask most body odors during physical activity. Given the \"sport\" monicker for that reason, but really this is more of a beach fragrance that resonates strongly with those who have spent an early, misty morning on a Northern Californian or Southern Oregonian pacific shore. This is one of the best souvenirs one can pick up to bring back images of the colder beaches of the northern California coast, wealthy in sea-life and seaweed along its banks. Projection and silage are fairly average, with longevity a bit of an issue, usually under 4-5 hours and wearing very close to the skin. Still, if you can appreciate more organic scents like seaweed, this is an incredibly original and unique extension of using organic notes. Polo Sport is very unique for its time, most likely more than a little inspired by the success of Nautica the year before and the influx of newer, trendier Polo inspired fashion houses taking a large portion of the 20 something crowd. The packaging itself reflects a time when the Ralph Lauren name was more vulnerable and less self-assured, trying to modernize with a new logo to go with its new jeans line, in an attempt to break from its illustrious past and more emphatically, the Baby Boomer generation. Polo Sport was Ralph Lauren's deliberate attempt to capture Generation X. Not refined for formal wear, but a fantastic, casual alternative to the plethora of synthetics on the market, Sport is original, organic and oceanic, like driving along Pacific 1 Highway with the top down on a September morning. A best seller largely because of the Polo name, but the Polo name does still stand for quality fabrics, oils and materials and not taking shortcuts in China. The Pacific Ocean in a bottle. Overall 4/5 (Quality 3.5/Originality 4.75/Projection 2.5/Longevity 2.5/Value 3.0/Scent 4.0) 17th November 2011100775drseidShow all reviewsA very disappointing generic smelling scent from Polo. It was as if RL tries to please everyone and instead pleases none fully. I don't get any originality here at all, and if this fragrance-by-poll scent is going to smell similar to every other \"sport\" scent, why bother? Pass on this one. 2 stars out of 5. 21st August 2011121868MOONBShow all reviewsCalone and cucumber notes . . . what's not to hate? Polo Sport is a fragrance I reviewed a while ago here on basenotes, but my words somehow got lost. Let me restate them: this fragrance is mediocre from start to finish, and it's not because it's a fruity aquatic fresh fougere. I can forgive the hundreds of entries in that genre if they each offer something distinctive to it. But that's a fantastic standard. Simply put, Polo Sport offers nothing. The tangerine and accompanying citruses are a chemical byproduct of whatever form of calone was used, a fact that becomes painfully obvious the longer you wear Polo. They never really fade, but just hang in there til the end. Then there's the middle, which is quite \"cool\" feeling. Like cucumbers on your eyes, this phase braces your nose, and is perhaps the only thing about the fragrance that feels good to me. Rapidly the coolness sullies into a faded version of itself, detached and marred by some pointlessly-integrated oakmoss and a vague suggestion of green herbs. Yes, Polo Sport is clearly an agent of freshness with plenty of practical utility in the gym locker room. Beyond that, it doesn't register as a serious fragrance, and is to be avoided. Unless, of course, you wish to remain inconspicuous, in which case I would say Polo Sport is your Holy Grail. 30th April 201190614colormechrisShow all reviewsWell, Polo Sport has a soft spot in my heart because I worked at the Polo store on Rodeo Drive when it first came out. That was an experience, and the smell of PSport brings it all back. Ralph himself even came in once with his wife and they just kind of stood around watching. Or were they sniffing? Cool Water had come out in 1988 but was just reaching the height of its popularity. Mr. Lauren, no dummy, knew a good thing when he smelled it. Thus Polo Sport was born. Let's not use the phrase \"rip off\". Ralph would never do that! But to say Polo Sport wasn't a direct descendent of Cool Water wouldn't be true either.The place was infused with the stuff. It was at every register. Perhaps I associate the cologne with clothing so the next logical step is laundry detergent. And it still smells that way to me. Like a big bottle of ALL or FAB or something. That's not neccessarily bad; but scented laundry detergent isn't exactly the height of olfactory finesse. And Polo Sport has about as much finesse as a box of Tide. But still...It has a certain fun, uplifting appeal to it, much like Clinique Happy. The fruit here, however, is not the ever dependable orange, but pineapple. Mixed with a ton of apparent aldehydes, the entire effect is sort of a CGI of Waikiki Beach. A \"seaweed\" note is said to be in each phase of the perfume, but nothing in there smells like seaweed to me. Seaweed is salty and earthy smelling. Polo Sport is sweet from start to finish.To sum, it's a great no-brainer for hot weather and hanging out at the beach, the lake, the pool...but go easy. It can annoy worse than a bratty teen-ager, and has about as much depth. But it can make you smile too. 30th January 201183979123 Next Most reviews in the last weekmanlyscents (8)Colbourne (8)Varanis Ridari (4)landshark321 (3)exmin (3)speedracer (3)RoamingRose (3)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)SPACEDOUT (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (28)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (8)Lian (7)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

It's a lovely floral, quite powdery. It recalls several other scents I wore in the 90s (like Vivid) that were a melange of flowers with some powder. They were easy to wear and smelled good. This one is especially nice in Spring.I had a small vintage bottle (appx 5mL) which I have now finished.

This was the BEST of the Lalique women's fragrances, and now it's gone. I would like to know who at Lalique decided on discontinuing this one. Whomever it is, or they are, they should be fired for discontinuing Lalique's namesake women's fragrance. I tell you, some of the younger executives at the fragrance companies certainly must have it out for the older customers who are accustomed to the older fragrances. It just tells me that their longtime customers are expendable and that they're only concerned about the bottom line instead of keeping their longtime customers happy. Lalique is very inconsiderate to their customers who bought this fragrance all those years. They are totally inconsiderate and selfish. It makes me question why I am buying Lalique products when they do this to their customers. A lot of other companies have discontinued their namesake fragrances, e.g., Gucci, Balenciaga, etc. It seems like fragrance companies are getting cheap with the essential oil content in their fragrances. I haven't found a fragrance in the last 10 years or so that is worth anything. Most men's fragrances nowadays don't last more than 5 or 10 minutes on the skin. Come on, fragrance companies, who are you trying to kid/swindle? We, or at least I, can tell you're getting cheaper by the day. 1st May 200711774FroFroShow all reviewsI liked it when tested, but didn't buy right away; considered for a while and eventually purchased it; since then, always have a bottle in my wardrobe.

There are exceptions, but by and large it is a very bland and ubiquitous genre served up to women in the same capacity as aquatics are to men. There really is only so much you can do with fruit and flowers before it smells like your average dryer sheet or salon product, but when an exception occurs, it strikes an accord with me that allows me to appreciate what can be done within the narrow purview of the category when it's done right. J'Adore by Dior (1999) is one such exception, and was originally composed by the phenomenal Calice Becker for Dior before François Demachy took up the mantle as house perfumer for the brand. To put things in perspective, it had been years since a new solid pillar took hold in the female perfume realm for the house. There was the doorbuster Poison (1985) created by Jean Guichard back in the 80's, with several flankers released in the years since which tried to tame the beast it was, then Dune (1991) showed up and brought some weird animal musk and sandy windswept florals together but without much fanfare, and finally Dolce Vita (1995) which proved to be successful, but not the generalist Dior needed to replace Poison as the flagship feminine. J'Adore ended up being that flagship for the brand because it was simple, well-crafted, and was more than the sum of its fruity floral parts, showing that a great perfume doesn't need costly ingredients or avant-garde style, just amazing execution within the given medium. Much like Chanel Cristalle (1974), J'Adore remains bouncy, lively, and fresh without being overly sweet. Granted, J'Adore is miles away happier than the icy bitch that is Cristalle, a sort of equal opposite if you will, but it presents its case earnestly. The opening of J'Adore is balmy calone shimmer as is expected from a 90's fragrance, but here it works as a pear and mandarin note creep in to join. This tropical sunset of a fragrance moves into lily of the valley after a while, with jasmine sambac in the heart, alongside a light plum and rose water combo that keeps things pretty and feminine without being super sweet or powdery. There is that galoxide shampoo smell here too that you either love or hate in perfumes like this, something also likened to the aforementioned dryer sheets, but here it just really sets the tone of the fragrance rather than dominates it, and I'm not one to hate on the use of synthetic aromachemicals if they are wielded with some skill. If the presence alone of modern scent molecules was enough to make me throw in the towel, I might as well resort to making my own perfumes or just buying from the oud dudes or attar makers online. There is a white musk along with some Iso E Super and dusting of cedar in the base, but the overall accord is held up with the chemicals so you get isolated pear and jasmine over rosewater for hours and hours, without anything like a traditional sandalwood or oakmoss base for any of this to mull into like a traditional chypre. J'Adore feels very linear for this reason but it was made at a time when linear is what people wanted; a single great-smelling accord from start to finish with no surprises to apologize for later on, unlike most of our beloved niche perfumes or heady complex vintage powerhouses with Baskin Robbin's 31 flavors of animal sac. As a generalist, J'Adore has the gumption to stand up in hot or cold, casual or work occasions, romantic liaisons and family gatherings, but does stumble some in formal situations where a \"happy\" scent might be off-putting to strangers. Wear time of the original eau de parfum is essentially all day, and sillage more than adequate, so this is no weak-sauce watery perfume despite the style in which it sits. The person who adores J'Adore is going to be that coworker or boss who just wants a shining beacon of fragrance to announce their arrival and linger just long enough after they've left to let everyone know they've been there if they weren't around to meet them when they showed up, but not necessarily to alarm anyone in the process. J'Adore disarms the person who enters its cloud, as it is oh so very clean, fresh, not sweet enough to cloy or impart a feeling of immaturity and mischief, but not dry or austere enough to command you to be on your guard. J'Adore is a \"good feeling\" fragrance when you don't want to be too exciting but also don't want to blend in with everyone's lavender fougère or orange blossom white floral. The fact that this is such an immaculate example of a maligned all-too-common genre in women's perfume is the one reason it remains so popular; this smells incredibly familiar yet better than most of the things you're liable to happen upon in the street when passing women (and some men) wearing these types of perfumes. I'd say this leans mostly feminine due to the heavy pear and jasmine sambac notes, but anyone with tastes for these notes could wear it, especially in the modern unisex niche perfume market. J'Adore gets pretty pricey for a designer, so definitely test first, and has a half-dozen iterations to boot, but if you're going to own just one fruity floral, it's hard to do better without going further back in time. Good deals do pop up from time to time, and that iconic bottle just looks so great sitting in a collection, with it's wound brass topper crowned with whatever that faux pearl is made of, that even niche snobs would have a difficult time begrudging you for adding it to your collection. Just a hard fragrance overall to dislike! Thumbs up! 4th August 2019219551HouseOfPhlegethonShow all reviewsA very fruity floral. Tons of fruit, in fact. Sharp floral mix, in the middle. It ends with vanilla and blackberry. Sweet spring or summer concoction. 3rd December 2017194794ADVERTISEMENTPossum-PieShow all reviewsLight airy floral/fruit frag. Has a bit of a lipstick drydown. Nice overall summer fragrance. 22nd July 2017189170odysseusmShow all reviewsA pretty, cheery and subtle floral. Slightly sweet but shows good taste. Light, nothing heavy here. Cute, clean and fun. If lightly applied it sits close to the skin and indeed becomes a good, somewhat sexy skin scent for a woman. 12th November 2016178873justchekinoutShow all reviewsI thought it would be another clean-smelling scent that doesn't stand out from a bunch of other scents from people on the streets, but it turns out that I haven't got bored of the scent after wearing it for two months! Maybe the chemistry really works well with the weather of the city I currently live in--hot and humid--and this white-floral scent makes me feel so refreshed every time I wear it. Recommend for spring and summer. 3rd July 2016173951CocoFlankerShow all reviewsI'm a sucker for everything jasmine-tuberose, but what made me keep this one -which I understand is the love/hate note- is the pear note, and what I love the most is the drydown. J'adore is an amazing blend of delicate and sweet, but also vibrant and sexy soft floral, fruity, musky notes.At first I felt the fruity note a bit sharp to the point of making my eyes itchy, but after an hour or so, the musky drydown made me fell for it.Let me put it this way: at first, it's a glamorous post-shower clean, but then it mutates into a flapper girl with a glass of sweet summer white wine in hand, lounging by the pool.I feel I can wear this -I acually do, as a matter of fact- with jeans+white top and I feel dressed. It's a summer scent, perfect for casual wear, night or day. Lasts about 8 hours on my skin. 8th April 2016170443KotoriShow all reviewsI don't think this is for me, because it is very popular, and very floral. However, I tried it on my skin for the first time today after years of passing it by without a thought, and there is something old-world feminine about it. There is a classic structure reminiscent of Diorella and Mitsouko, but with a brighter, more linear effect. It is sunny without being shrill. On the card, the ylang ylang and tuberose screech. On my skin, however, the fruit ripens, and I get a mezzo-soprano voice with mellow vibrato and a hint of dark edges. I think I could wear this. I understand what people say when they say it smells like shampoo, but I think that's a chicken-or-egg issue. I think J'Adore must've inspired some of the functional perfumery in the last decade and a half since its release. 22nd November 2015164562OviattShow all reviewsThis is fine French perfumery brought up to date--feminine, sunny and chic, this is a perfect representation of the brand as it is today--a (perhaps THE) great couture house, still relevant in the current day. A fruity floral with Ylang, rose, jasmine and tuberose, lightened by aldehydes and anchored with sandalwood, this is a textbook composition done right. Does it shout for attention? Does it stand out in a crowd? No, but a woman wearing J'Adore will always be one of the best smelling women in the room. Wonderful packaging and marketing, with the beautiful Charlize Theron, sunny, chic and feminine herself, perfectly representing this lovely offering from the House of Dior. 29th October 2015163542clamnoleShow all reviewsMy wife owns this fragrance, and along with Miss Dior they are both my all time favorites. J'Adore is just so sweet and subtle. The floral notes are perfectly light. J'Adore makes me very happy when I detect it on my wife. It's light and draws me in and I always want to get close to her to smell it on her skin. A perfect fragrance for a happy marriage IMO. 12th May 2015156264MmcleanShow all reviewsThis fragrance reminds me of a wedding day. Flowers everywhere and sun beaming in the church. It is floral sweet bouquet, pretty and elegant. Whenever I want to feel feminine I reach for this. Opening notes can be quite strong initially but give it a few minutes and it mellows beautifully. 21st March 2015153430Colin MaillardShow all reviewsJ'adore is one of those modern classics we may take for granted: it's solid, always pleasant in pretty much any circumstance, stylish yet undemanding and carefree. A soapy-fruity blend with a fresh, invigorating opening of bergamot notes and peach, then white flowers, vanilla, a silky and clean jasmine deprived of its earthy-indolicness, with a beautiful crystalline rose note on a mellow base of sweet sandalwood and discreet cedar. All perfectly rounded and made a bit more adult by aldehydes and darker floral notes (tuberose). A fruity-powdery scent, if you want: a bit conventional and not a wow, probably, but with a really pleasant and cozy fresh, golden, white-plushy sense of liveliness, this making it quite appealing also for younger audiences. Yet it is also rich, slightly shady if you pay attention, with a thin feel of something more adult and sensual floating all over. Classy and cheerful. Not memorable, probably, and not the most distinctive scent around, but not all scents have to be like that; J'adore is a timeless, perfect, carefree and safe scent which can make pretty much any woman (or man) smell elegant, discreetly confident, generically sophisticated with a hint of urban-young allure in pretty much any situation. One of the several mainstream scents far superior to niche floral ones which rip them off at twice the price. Recommended! 7,5-8/10 24th November 2014148939L'homme vertShow all reviews*This review pertains to the original 'parfum' version circa 2000, the earlier extrait of J'Adore is more complex, verdant & lacks the syrupy sweetness found in later re-formulations, also the florals & raw materials used are of superb quality, a beautifully blended fragrance indeed, absolutely breathtaking !This would have to be the very best version of J'Adore available, one of Calice Beckers greatest creations. The original parfum contains both Maroc and Turkish rose, Ch.magnolia absolute, jasmine abs. (Grasse), Comoros ylang ylang & damas plum with a base of rare woods including high quality sandal and amaranth. Not as sweet as the more recent eau de parfum & toilette presentations including it's associated flankers although silage & staying power is phenomenal, projects well when used in combination with the lesser concentrations &/or a moisturizing body product (best when layered). The high quality florals are beautifully blended along with the Chinese magnolia and Cassis bud, this parfum imparts a luxurious silky feel on skin & is both a joy to apply & wear, I'm not sure if this 1999 formula is still being produced (highly unlikely), either way I would suggest searching for and stocking up if possible on this glittering gem of modern perfumery. Get it now while you still can, it's not that easily found so you may need to hunt it down, I guard my supplies zealously. . .It is certainly worth the effort, liquid 'GOLD' !\"Bon Chance\". . . 20th July 2014144068WingieShow all reviewsThis review is for the original formulation, sold in 1999. There is a difference!The original version, sold in 1999, is very good; a classic for its era, which was largely an era of fruity-florals. The J'Adore that is being sold in stores today is crap. Pure crap. I think the distinguishment between the two needs to be made because there are reviews of what seem to be the current version saying it smells like house cleaner, shampoo, soap, etc, which is true. J'Adore has been reformulated - more than once I believe - with detrimental results. But the original formulation is good, one of the best fruity-florals to come out of the 1990s. It can still be found on ebay, the box shows the Christian Dior label in a purple circle instead of a gold one. It is on my wishlist as a collector's item because I know one day it will no longer be available. Samples of the older version can also be found at Surrender to Chance. Even if you smell the current version and like it, I encourage you to seek out the original version. To me there is no point owning the current stuff when the real McCoy can still be had and is miles better.Pros: A classic; one of the best in the fruity-floral category.Cons: The original formula can only be found today on ebay.\" 23rd August 2013131240DiamondflameShow all reviewsA clean mildly soapy floral. J'ADORE is not particularly interesting but it is rather well made. And I cannot deny its delicately feminine girl-next-door charms. I think it makes a perfectly versatile fragrance for long summer days. 27th March 2012107899Wee Scottish Scent LoverShow all reviewsNo matter how many other perfumes I fall in love with, I never fall out of love with J'Adore. It is just overwhelmingly feminine and beautiful. I think it's the only fragrance which I still love in spite of the fact so many others wear it. It is the essence of summer time, yet it suits all seasons. In my opinion it is the most elegant of scents, not trying to be anything it isn't, just a perfect formulation of jasmine and rose, and it will always have a welcome place in my boudoir! 16th March 2012106740noirdrakkarShow all reviewsMale perspective: This is by far the best perfume that I ever smelled. 20th December 2011102289miss millsShow all reviewsCharming, infinitely feminine and very floral and clean smelling. I have such mixed feelings for this perfume as it is the one my best friend wore for years and years and I would buy it for her birthday - she passed away so tragically and suddenly last winter that (I feel so emotional just writing this much) now that I have her used bottles that she left behind, the ones I gave to her, every time I smell it I am overcome with longing for my friend to still be here.I will buy a purse sized J'Adore to remind me of her always. It was never the scent for me, I am definitely more of a Hypnotic Poison gal but an occasional dab will help keep my precious Cherylee forever alive to me.27th September 201198105LeilahdancerShow all reviewsWell, now. I've worn J'Adore EDP for a few years now, but I have only recently begun to expand my understanding of fragrance. I really wish the notes were listed for this, because I'm sure my ignorant nose will miss all the good stuff!I like the opening with fresh, white flowers and bit of soap. The middle came on as quite soapy and I don't like it quite as well. The dry down though... that I love. A little musk with some floral and hint of fresh baked cookie.The sillage has been perfect, so far. I've only had it on for three hours now. We'll see how the longevity goes.My new education tells me I still like this, but I wish the middle was less soapy. 7th September 201197032queen_shebaShow all reviewsI'm so sad others don't feel the same way as me about J'Adore. I \"adore\" this fragrance - every time I smell, either the top, heart or base notes I am charmed by its elegance.Its sillage is excellent, the basenotes are delicious and it just radiates femininity to me. I feel a million dollars wearing it. The way it develops on my skin is just perfect.It's one of my next to purchase! 20th June 201193096lady loveShow all reviewsThis is just one of the best perfumes of all time. I can't live without one bottle of Jadore, cuz is the essence of true elegance.Sweet, soft, feminine, sophisticated, and with a long power lasting without being overwhelming. Everybody know this perfume is a new classic. 28th January 201183867foetidusShow all reviewsFresh, floral, and fruity. The opening of the scent has a clear, balanced, and refined fruitiness that coordinates beautifully with the florals of the middle. The middle mixed florals carry those same kinds of balance and refinement that the fruit notes have, and that is, basically, the strong point of this fragrance: it does not have a strong single identifiable characteristic except that it is so beautifully combined of wonderfully complementary notes. Although it does lack a distinct personality, it would be almost impossible for J'Adore to be disagreeable. It is safe–it shows taste and refinement if not uniqueness. I think it might have been taken as an inspiration for Vera Wang for Men. 3rd December 201079957mysolegiaShow all reviewsThe EDP is strong stuff, use sparingly otherwise you'll get a headache.I like this fragrance, especially in the late spring early summer months. It hasn't attracted bees to my wrists so that's especially a plus for me. I detect a honey-amber base to it, which I find intriguing, identifiable and IMO unusual. Would I purchase a bottle of it? Not likely, but it's a gift that I wouldn't mind getting and using. Nicely done. 28th May 201056230shoegal68Show all reviewsLove this and that's all there is to it, it's pretty, there I said it...

It mostly reminded me of shampoo, and it was OK, but nothing great. It got very screechy on me, and veered into headache territory pretty easily. Gorgeous bottle, boring juice. 27th September 20202342632nosedtwinShow all reviewsJ'Adore - Christian DiorAfter a watery-fruity start this thing quickly swifts into a evenly fruity-floral (peach-plum-apricot-banana vs rose-muguet) fuzzy waxy tonality with something that reminds me of the fattiness of sheepwool, which I like very much. It gets elevated into a luscious summery seebreeze airyness with whiffs of wood glue and tealeaves which gives it a rough edged feel. At some point it had me thinking of a water-downed version of Allure pour homme. A central jasmine-ylangylang combo gets dragged into the dryout and gives it a syrupy plummy sweetness and as contrast, a suprising dark bitter-sour accent of blackberry. It further develops a kind of 'dewed' vanilla and white musk-amber tone with slightly burned plastic/rubbery undertones and a sharp soapy feel. All in all the whole perfume smells a bit too chemical and crude. Not bad but also not very original, a slightly Dior-unworthy perfume. 17th June 2019217841ADVERTISEMENTBal a VersaillesShow all reviewsThis review is for J'Adore Touche, given to me as a 1 ml sample. It's a muskier version of Jardins de Bagatelle, tuberose rich and the rest all thrown in. Nothing new here but very nice. 29th November 2016179346rskookydoughShow all reviewsMy daughter received this as a gift from a new boyfriend. He did not know her very well because this is not for her. She thinks this scent is old lady. I don't know were that is coming from. I seen a review on this that said it smells good on paper. That hits the nail right on the head. I wanted to like this because it is so pretty and floral. It ends up just smelling waxy after a few hours on my skin. 22nd October 2015163222IzzieShow all reviewsIt's a pleasant fragrance, it really is, but there is nothing really interesting about it. It smells like shampoo, to me. And I like the way most shampoo smells, so I'm not saying it's off-putting, there's just nothing particularly unique about it. It's one of those fragrances that I would have a hard time pointing out if I came across someone wearing it. I get as far as \"that smells nice\", but I can't pinpoint anything specific or particular about it that makes me go \"oh, yeah, that's J'Adore\"That said, it is clean, inoffensive, easy to wear, feminine and \"pretty\". Probably great for women out there who aren't particularly interested in fragrances beyond wanting to smell good and inoffensive. But to someone who's smelled a lot of fragrances, this is dull, uninspired and common. 6th January 2013122330emelleShow all reviewsit is for young women i think. it is really innocent and lovely .it is clean and sweet and shy.i really rocemmend this perfume .but i can't say it is for me now.i am seeking something that is more ambitious and brave. i used to have this but i don't want to have this any more. 4th July 2012113096trikkirikkiShow all reviewsI really want to like this. It's fine on paper, the notes should work really well together, and I love this type of fragrance in general. But when it hits my skin nothing happens. It smells the same throughout, from top to base. The plum gets sticky sweet on my skin, and there is nothing there to balance it out. Maybe its just chemistry. It's still pleasant enough, but dull, so dull. Everyday wear for someone else, not for me. 4th January 2012102913DarvantShow all reviewsThe J'Adore dry down, with its rosey and slightly fruity-soapy multifaceted floral wake, is a sort of veritable redemption for a scent that starts somewhat uninteresting with a watery (almost aquatic) orangy-irony laundry feel (aroused by citrus and ylang-ylang in a way that evokes, with its angular trait, the intense lily of the valley presence on the side of citrus) and evolves towards a middle phase that is deeply floral due to a valzer of rose, jasmine and tuberose. The juice is fresh and joyful, sensual and dynamic, dry and changeful. The musky vanilla of the base is delicate and well balanced in order to introduce a touch of smoothness and to amalgamate the complexity of the floral notes. Nothing  bad with this renowned juice but it's simply not the kind of fragrance i rave for. 16th December 2011148936Dame PigletShow all reviewsAbrasive top notes dry down to Dial soap scent on me. My friends have all remarked that \"it's not bad, but smells like cheap perfume.\" On someone with different chemistry it may be wonderful. I detect no fruit in the fragrance at all. 20th May 201191550blood-orangeShow all reviewsI must say I was rather surprised by this fragrance. By just looking at the bottle, the advertisements and the overall love that people have for this, I was expecting your typical floral that smells comforting, yet so much like Grandma. I was quite astounded by its fruity notes when I first sprayed J'adore. It wasn't a horrid blast of citrus or overly sweetened fruits, it was more subdued and sophisticated. If I had to pick a fragrance that was similar in its composition, elegance and style, I would say Miss Dior Cherie is rather similar. The scent itself is indeed very strong, but for me that is a quality that I enjoy in my perfumes. It definitely, in my opinion, has the potential to be a very seductive and sexy fragrance, as I have heard that many men prefer fruity scents on their women. I believe that this scent would be signature worthy because it is not something that I can imagine someone tiring of quickly. Although best suited to special occasions and nightwear, I can imagine this being worn as a casual fragrance. I believe that its versatility relies on how much scent you apply to your skin. Remember that less is more when you use J'adore.26th April 201190308MizzalotShow all reviewsI really love the scent of this perfume! Sophisticated, original, feminine, classy,...Unfortunately it fades away very quickly on my skin.Too bad... 20th December 201081113LorettagraceShow all reviewsWarm, fresh. A little soapy, at least on my skin. Reminds me a little bit of Sensuous by Estee Lauder -- at least, in the way that it's warm smelling. I get more freshness than sweetness. I don't get any fruit at all -- I'm not sure why anyone would smell fruit on this, but I know chemistry is weird. There's nothing unpleasant about it, but nothing really great either. Maybe it's just not my style. 29th December 200974169pinkfizzyShow all reviewsCitrussy peachy rose. I have a sample of EdP and it's so watery and weak I could have sworn it was cologne or EdT. I would have liked it more if they'd amped up the peach and rose a bit more and fleshed it out a bit. And it gave me a rash.But it's not bad for a modern fruity floral. Much classier than most of them out there nowadays. 15th September 200969873cjkammShow all reviewsA pretty floral scent, nothing different or daring. Reminds me of Tresor. 15th July 200971353NostalgieShow all reviewsThis is a fruity floral, with the peach and rose standing out most for me. If it were color it would be the peachy pink of some excellent dry French rosés. A very fresh, almost (but not quite) sophisticated non-bold floral. It starts out a bit too fruity but calms down some. A little more bright than I like my perfumes, but very nice and wearable.The dry down is soft and cheerful. I can't say I adore it. But it's nice. Just nice. Attractive bottle design. 10th July 200960500mikey_pShow all reviewsThis is an acceptable quality fresh floral but nothing particularly interesting. The Absolu version boosts the florals so much more beautifully, that this version seems oddly redundant. 11th June 200914565AshaShow all reviewsDior J'AdoreNotes: mandarin, champaca flowers, ivy, african orchid, rose, violet, damascus plum, amaranth wood, blackberry musk (from Sephora)I never smelled J'Adore before, and had always read it is a peachy floral. I can't say I am disappointed--there is indeed some very juicy peach and a soft, powdery rose which turns bitter and \"perfumy\" later in the development. The fragrance is quite pleasant, although the rose presentation reminds me of an old-fashioned rose fragrance. If it weren't for the peach note, the rose would deteriorate into a sickly rose soliflore, the kind that gives rose a bad name in perfumery. Yet, there is a familiar comfort to this fragrance--the fruit and floral are not candy-like, and the powder is not sweet. J'Adore is sophisticated and evokes a confident maturity. The peach and rose die down into the middle portion of the fragrance, letting the other mixed florals come forth. But, the peach never really stops--it stays in the background to give a cushioned framework for the florals to settle. This is well and truly a feminine composition. I am not bowled over by it, but I do marvel at the composure this fragrance has, and how it has a calming effect on my mood. Dior J'Adore L'Eau Cologne Florale (2009 release)Notes: bergamot, magnolia, neroli (from NowSmellThis)Who put Miss Dior Cherie into my J'Adore? At first spray, I smelled soft and light notes of watery peach and grapefruit in a cloud of soft florals. It smells GREAT on paper. On my skin, the fresh and slightly biting grapefruit note turn bitter in the same way that Miss Dior Cherie has a bitter, medicinal edge. It is as if I failed to correctly swallow an aspirin, was left with a terrible taste in my mouth, and attempts to wash it down with fruit punch did not work. Thankfully, later in the development, the fragrance tempers a bit. The peach and floral notes stay prominent well into the drydown, reminding me that this is indeed J'Adore and not necessarily a hollow version of itself. I wonder though--who is it that thinks if you add a dose of acidic or sour smelling notes, that a fragrance suddenly becomes \"light and fresh\"? I must admit, J'Adore L'Eau is not really unpleasant in any way. However, I am having a hard time accepting that the original, composed and calm J'Adore can be easily converted into a fresher version by adding the olfactory equivalent of Vitamin C. Was the original not fresh enough? Alas, I am sucked in by the modern, sparkly quality J'Adore L'Eau has. It fits my idea of a clean, fruity, floral and slightly soapy fragrance done in the contemporary style. 11th May 200950084marmaldeskyShow all reviewsThis just smells so...90s. I realize that it came out in 1999, but it smells like something every woman my mother's age wore in the 1990s. It isn't bad, and I might wear it at some point (Sephora sent me three samples of J'Adore in a bonus sample grab bag gift) but it's so reminiscent as to be distracting. It's just not me I guess. 10th November 200861552sugarplum123Show all reviewsI thought that this smelled very sophisticated but it's probably designed for older women. As a teenager, i would not wear this scent as it feels too overpowering. 16th October 200862017HORACIO GONZÁLEZShow all reviewsnot bad but a little offensive, how to say, just a little invasive, sorry 31st August 200838435purplebird7Show all reviewsIt would take an army to steer me away from my favorite Dior fragrance, Miss Dior. (No, I take that back--if they reformulate it any more, I will refuse to buy it again.) Apparently my tastes do not agree with the masses. J'Adore is popular. Indeed, it is pleasant, and I can see why so many people like it. This genre of light, fruity florals is not my favorite. There are too many silly, simple ones. I wonder if most people wear them because they missed the chance to try anything better. For a fruity floral, I think Geir Ness Laila is more interesting. This is a Norweigan perfume of \"mountain wildflowers\" and a watermelon note, made with no synthetics--pretty amazing. I'll leave J'adore to the masses. 25th April 200826171AmberflashShow all reviewssmells pretty.... but it's the poster child I'd say for boring, run-of-the-mill fruity florals. Doesn't smell cheap and has a pleasant composition, so it's a safe one to wear to the office or an interview, maybe, or anywhere you want to appear sophisticated without appearing altogether original. 7th May 200739000tmgp24Show all reviewsthis used to be my favorite perfume.i got it when it first came out in 1999.the last 2 bottles i bought(within 4 month period)have not smelled right.i brought them back to dillard's and the clerks and manager all said that the perfume smelled sour.i will not be buying it any more.nice thing was they gave me a bottle of miss dior cherie and organza to takes it's place(plus a bunch of samples) 3rd March 200738113sherrie11Show all reviewsI enjoy most of the Dior fragrances. J'Adore is a very *nice* fragrance but it doesn't knock my socks off. Maybe that's a good thing - there's always room in my wardrobe for a *nice* generic fragrance to wear to a funeral or christening or something. (!!) \"Generic\" is too extreme, though. J'Adore is not quite generic, but it's not special with a capital \"S\", though I do like it. I love the bottle. 29th October 20062072112 Next Most reviews in the last weekmanlyscents (8)Colbourne (8)Varanis Ridari (4)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)landshark321 (3)exmin (3)speedracer (3)RoamingRose (3)SPACEDOUT (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (28)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)Callista25 (9)landshark321 (9)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (8)Lian (7)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

Almost nauseating and the price is really too excessive. There are better perfumes that are much cheaper. 13th April 2021241503marimariShow all reviewsBought a 5 ml sample to test-drive it. Too sharp, floral and sweet and very expensive for such a vulgar fragrance. Reminds me of the cheap fragrances by Avon. You would expect something at least 10 times better from Dior. Tacky, for people with no taste at all, who are happy to spend gobs of money to show off their expendable wealth. The first image that comes to my mind after smelling it is of a bunch of nouveau riche moms in their late 30's meeting inside an elevator at a condo while going for a tea around the center table showing off their perfumes to each other and commenting about their prices. 28th February 2018198460ADVERTISEMENTjepifishShow all reviewsWhat a horribly tacky scent -- cloying and excessively saccharine; I hated it from the first spritz, but by God is it difficult to get rid of. There's no personality, just constant sweetness, like opening a packet of stale, powdered doughnuts. 31st December 2017195888CookBotShow all reviewsA Snuggle dryer sheet that's been used to wipe down a potted faux rosebush with an anonymous white musk shampoo.J'Adios.20th September 2017191575Way Off ScenterShow all reviewsGenre: Fruity FloralAny fruity floral scent joining a line that already includes Diorella needs to be a lot better than J'Adore to justify its existence. Calice Becker's floral compositions sometimes take on an overly abstract, almost faceless quality. This is true to some degree of Beyond Paradise, but very much the case with J'Adore. There's nothing particularly wrong with J'Adore's lactonic peachy floral accord, but it never smells more than bland and sweet to me. There's none of the crisp, cheerful green tea that enlivens Becker's Tommy Girl, nor any of the luxurious tuberose that elevates J'Adore's l'Absolut version. For me , though, the ultimate deal-breaker is a white musk drydown that's a dead ringer for my current shampoo. (Kérastase Resistance.) I think I can live without J'Adore.2014:Either I've become less tolerant with age, or J'Adore's formula has been cheapened. I now find the fruity notes at J'Adore's heart unpleasantly cloying.18th June 2014143392masamim10Show all reviewsReally wanted to love this... but all I detect is powder, powder, and... powder. It makes me want to sneeze! Sorry, must not be for me. Seeing the popularity of this scent, I assume it probably smells better on the people it works on than in the bottle. 16th March 2014136789Mufta MammaShow all reviewsUnlike Wingie, I wasn't fortunate enough to obtain a sample of the original scent, but I whole-heartedly agree that the newer J'Adore is terrible. It's an overpowering concoction of Ylang-Ylang, musk, and some foul fixative. I reserve single-star reviews for fragrances that contain the formic-acid-scented fixitives found in the cheapest of colognes and perfumes. This fragrance nearly obtained that dubious honor. 31st January 2014134954CricketkittyShow all reviewsI know I am in the minority here, but I think this stinks. If you like \"clean\" fragrances this is for you, because to me it smells like something you would clean your house with. 2nd September 2012115992Mimi GardeniaShow all reviewsThree notes listed on dior.com- ylang ylang, damask rose and jasmine sambac. Well ,we all know there is much more to J'Adore than those three notes. What about the champaca ?? I find it interesting that on the Dior website, their olfactory notes section doesn't tell us more than three notes for each scent. Dear Dior.com People, do you think that we ,the general public , are unable to process the idea of more than three notes at a time ???Personally I dislike that elongated bottle neck a lot . Personally, I don't know how J'Adore stays so popular as to be No 1 on the bestseller lists. Be prepared for negativity in this little review /sampling note . Apologies to all who love this scent. Believe me, my life would be much simpler and my wallet fatter, if I also loved this scent more than others ! Today I was obsessed with re sniffing J'Adore. I don't know how The Fragrance Demons attack me in the night that I awake with such a desire to re sniff something I already know, I am not very fond of to begin with ! Off to Cow Town Mall I went.J'Adore EDP is beautiful to begin with . There is a classical glow at first with such a blend of jasmine , rose and ylang ylang that I get this peachiness. It's like 'diffusive silk' . I love my peach so this was good smelling so far. J'Adore at this point is pretty and swoon worthy . It does seem to present some kind of olfactory picture of \" Gold\" . I thought to myself \" I don't remember J'Adore smelling this romantic and gorgeous. \"Fast forward to the drydown . This is where my problem with J'Adore occurs. I come across this nose WALL block - perhaps it's the fruity blackberry ,perhaps violets and musk combo that really is awful on me. It's like wet cardboard - dank ,screechy ,artificial and this is the character smell of J'Adore I always associate with it. Too bad. The opening of J'Adore is gorgeous and the drydown is like some schizoid character on my skin. That schizoid character just loves to hang around . Hours later and I am smelling seriously of cardboard. it sits right here on my arm and firmly in my poor nose. It could be worse, J'Adore Eau de Cardboard could've given me a migraine but it doesn't. For this, it gets ' un point '.If I had not waited till the dry down and bought J'Adore on the spot based on that silky waft of peachy-rose-jasmine , I would have been upset .That wall block of offensiveness at the dry down - such a chemical spill on my skin - would have made me take my purchase right back to Cow Town Mall for my refund. 10th June 2012111970MinkymaidShow all reviewsPeach, rose, soap, safe. Saying anything unpleasant about this scent feels like shouting at a teddy bear - who could be so mean? However, the image of nice mummies having lunch while the washing machine spins in the background springs to mind. I find this a cloying scent lying over fresh laundered clothes. Thousands like it, but its just not for me. 4th February 2012104381katk925Show all reviewsI really loved this when I sprayed it on the card but when I finally tried it on my skin I got the same gross soap undertone the person below me said. EWWW 14th June 201192839GrottolaShow all reviewsI hate to jump on the negative bandwagon here, but add me to the chorus that thinks J'Adore smells like a shampoo. It's a fruity-floral that doesn't necessarily smell cheap, just shampoo-like. 17th February 201185285GelbeDominoShow all reviewsI am so very tempted to write a review that just says \"Blech!\" but I won't.I am sampling the EDP: it smells cheap and cloying, like pear candy at first and like shampoo as it dries down. It is making my nostrils ache. Honest.Not complex at all, which isn't a bad thing in itself.Simple scents can be nice (I enjoy my Rosines and Goutals, after all) but when they are executed in a more delicate and sophisticated way than this.If you want to smell like pear candy and shampoo, well, stop at the candy store and wash your hair. 3rd February 201184380jimmyguoShow all reviewsAbout as mass-market a female fragrance can become. I am completely unable to distinguish any of the singular floral notes (where's the champaca?) other than a starkly synthetic rose accord. Basically, it smells like some cheap hair product and nothing like the refined french luxury Dior is trying to sell us. 5th January 201182063BetsyMeszarosShow all reviewsI tried it for the first time yesterday. It's so bad I don't even know where to begin. I just don't get it. 29th September 201079067LiveJazzShow all reviewsSo, I am the second person in a row to think J'Adore smells like shampoo. And no, I didn't read Off-Scenter's review before I smelled it. It doesn't smell bad. I guess I just don't see the point. I expect much more from Dior. 8th July 201022662Jean Patou FanShow all reviewsI really couldn't believe J'Adore when I first tried it: brash and aggressive, it smells more like hair lacquer than fine perfume. I'm sorry I really can't find anything positive to say about J'Adore. Nasty and aggressive, it gives me an instant headache 29th March 201074809CarrieShow all reviewsA screamingly overpowering floral that screams and shouts in bright, glaring lights. Too loud; an unrefined scent that heads straight for the pit of your stomach. 5th November 200973871PrometheaShow all reviewsYuck. If I was trying this blind, I would have guessed this a very cheap perfume indeed. A nasty, synthetic, almost metallic peach smell dominates this when sniffing it on my wrist. Sillage is apparently impressive - my flatmate recoiled at the smell from a distance of 12 feet to ask in polite disgust what on earth I was wearing. And that from one small spay to my wrist. Closer examination of the scent from said flatmate elicted the further opinion that the scent at close quarters smelled like BO being covered by cheap scent. Not a keeper. 2nd February 200965239TrufflesShow all reviewsThis smells exactly like some dirt-cheap Spanish perfume I smelled while on holiday as a teenager about 20 years ago. So basically I'm not a fan and with the exception of Midnight Poison I don't as a rule like Dior perfumes anyway. 20th October 200862067takemyhusbandplzShow all reviewsSorry, but my first impression was to run away from the awful stench. Must be my chemistry.

There are exceptions, but by and large it is a very bland and ubiquitous genre served up to women in the same capacity as aquatics are to men. There really is only so much you can do with fruit and flowers before it smells like your average dryer sheet or salon product, but when an exception occurs, it strikes an accord with me that allows me to appreciate what can be done within the narrow purview of the category when it's done right. J'Adore by Dior (1999) is one such exception, and was originally composed by the phenomenal Calice Becker for Dior before François Demachy took up the mantle as house perfumer for the brand. To put things in perspective, it had been years since a new solid pillar took hold in the female perfume realm for the house. There was the doorbuster Poison (1985) created by Jean Guichard back in the 80's, with several flankers released in the years since which tried to tame the beast it was, then Dune (1991) showed up and brought some weird animal musk and sandy windswept florals together but without much fanfare, and finally Dolce Vita (1995) which proved to be successful, but not the generalist Dior needed to replace Poison as the flagship feminine. J'Adore ended up being that flagship for the brand because it was simple, well-crafted, and was more than the sum of its fruity floral parts, showing that a great perfume doesn't need costly ingredients or avant-garde style, just amazing execution within the given medium. Much like Chanel Cristalle (1974), J'Adore remains bouncy, lively, and fresh without being overly sweet. Granted, J'Adore is miles away happier than the icy bitch that is Cristalle, a sort of equal opposite if you will, but it presents its case earnestly. The opening of J'Adore is balmy calone shimmer as is expected from a 90's fragrance, but here it works as a pear and mandarin note creep in to join. This tropical sunset of a fragrance moves into lily of the valley after a while, with jasmine sambac in the heart, alongside a light plum and rose water combo that keeps things pretty and feminine without being super sweet or powdery. There is that galoxide shampoo smell here too that you either love or hate in perfumes like this, something also likened to the aforementioned dryer sheets, but here it just really sets the tone of the fragrance rather than dominates it, and I'm not one to hate on the use of synthetic aromachemicals if they are wielded with some skill. If the presence alone of modern scent molecules was enough to make me throw in the towel, I might as well resort to making my own perfumes or just buying from the oud dudes or attar makers online. There is a white musk along with some Iso E Super and dusting of cedar in the base, but the overall accord is held up with the chemicals so you get isolated pear and jasmine over rosewater for hours and hours, without anything like a traditional sandalwood or oakmoss base for any of this to mull into like a traditional chypre. J'Adore feels very linear for this reason but it was made at a time when linear is what people wanted; a single great-smelling accord from start to finish with no surprises to apologize for later on, unlike most of our beloved niche perfumes or heady complex vintage powerhouses with Baskin Robbin's 31 flavors of animal sac. As a generalist, J'Adore has the gumption to stand up in hot or cold, casual or work occasions, romantic liaisons and family gatherings, but does stumble some in formal situations where a \"happy\" scent might be off-putting to strangers. Wear time of the original eau de parfum is essentially all day, and sillage more than adequate, so this is no weak-sauce watery perfume despite the style in which it sits. The person who adores J'Adore is going to be that coworker or boss who just wants a shining beacon of fragrance to announce their arrival and linger just long enough after they've left to let everyone know they've been there if they weren't around to meet them when they showed up, but not necessarily to alarm anyone in the process. J'Adore disarms the person who enters its cloud, as it is oh so very clean, fresh, not sweet enough to cloy or impart a feeling of immaturity and mischief, but not dry or austere enough to command you to be on your guard. J'Adore is a \"good feeling\" fragrance when you don't want to be too exciting but also don't want to blend in with everyone's lavender fougère or orange blossom white floral. The fact that this is such an immaculate example of a maligned all-too-common genre in women's perfume is the one reason it remains so popular; this smells incredibly familiar yet better than most of the things you're liable to happen upon in the street when passing women (and some men) wearing these types of perfumes. I'd say this leans mostly feminine due to the heavy pear and jasmine sambac notes, but anyone with tastes for these notes could wear it, especially in the modern unisex niche perfume market. J'Adore gets pretty pricey for a designer, so definitely test first, and has a half-dozen iterations to boot, but if you're going to own just one fruity floral, it's hard to do better without going further back in time. Good deals do pop up from time to time, and that iconic bottle just looks so great sitting in a collection, with it's wound brass topper crowned with whatever that faux pearl is made of, that even niche snobs would have a difficult time begrudging you for adding it to your collection. Just a hard fragrance overall to dislike! Thumbs up! 4th August 2019219551HouseOfPhlegethonShow all reviewsA very fruity floral. Tons of fruit, in fact. Sharp floral mix, in the middle. It ends with vanilla and blackberry. Sweet spring or summer concoction. 3rd December 2017194794ADVERTISEMENTPossum-PieShow all reviewsLight airy floral/fruit frag. Has a bit of a lipstick drydown. Nice overall summer fragrance. 22nd July 2017189170odysseusmShow all reviewsA pretty, cheery and subtle floral. Slightly sweet but shows good taste. Light, nothing heavy here. Cute, clean and fun. If lightly applied it sits close to the skin and indeed becomes a good, somewhat sexy skin scent for a woman. 12th November 2016178873justchekinoutShow all reviewsI thought it would be another clean-smelling scent that doesn't stand out from a bunch of other scents from people on the streets, but it turns out that I haven't got bored of the scent after wearing it for two months! Maybe the chemistry really works well with the weather of the city I currently live in--hot and humid--and this white-floral scent makes me feel so refreshed every time I wear it. Recommend for spring and summer. 3rd July 2016173951CocoFlankerShow all reviewsI'm a sucker for everything jasmine-tuberose, but what made me keep this one -which I understand is the love/hate note- is the pear note, and what I love the most is the drydown. J'adore is an amazing blend of delicate and sweet, but also vibrant and sexy soft floral, fruity, musky notes.At first I felt the fruity note a bit sharp to the point of making my eyes itchy, but after an hour or so, the musky drydown made me fell for it.Let me put it this way: at first, it's a glamorous post-shower clean, but then it mutates into a flapper girl with a glass of sweet summer white wine in hand, lounging by the pool.I feel I can wear this -I acually do, as a matter of fact- with jeans+white top and I feel dressed. It's a summer scent, perfect for casual wear, night or day. Lasts about 8 hours on my skin. 8th April 2016170443KotoriShow all reviewsI don't think this is for me, because it is very popular, and very floral. However, I tried it on my skin for the first time today after years of passing it by without a thought, and there is something old-world feminine about it. There is a classic structure reminiscent of Diorella and Mitsouko, but with a brighter, more linear effect. It is sunny without being shrill. On the card, the ylang ylang and tuberose screech. On my skin, however, the fruit ripens, and I get a mezzo-soprano voice with mellow vibrato and a hint of dark edges. I think I could wear this. I understand what people say when they say it smells like shampoo, but I think that's a chicken-or-egg issue. I think J'Adore must've inspired some of the functional perfumery in the last decade and a half since its release. 22nd November 2015164562OviattShow all reviewsThis is fine French perfumery brought up to date--feminine, sunny and chic, this is a perfect representation of the brand as it is today--a (perhaps THE) great couture house, still relevant in the current day. A fruity floral with Ylang, rose, jasmine and tuberose, lightened by aldehydes and anchored with sandalwood, this is a textbook composition done right. Does it shout for attention? Does it stand out in a crowd? No, but a woman wearing J'Adore will always be one of the best smelling women in the room. Wonderful packaging and marketing, with the beautiful Charlize Theron, sunny, chic and feminine herself, perfectly representing this lovely offering from the House of Dior. 29th October 2015163542clamnoleShow all reviewsMy wife owns this fragrance, and along with Miss Dior they are both my all time favorites. J'Adore is just so sweet and subtle. The floral notes are perfectly light. J'Adore makes me very happy when I detect it on my wife. It's light and draws me in and I always want to get close to her to smell it on her skin. A perfect fragrance for a happy marriage IMO. 12th May 2015156264MmcleanShow all reviewsThis fragrance reminds me of a wedding day. Flowers everywhere and sun beaming in the church. It is floral sweet bouquet, pretty and elegant. Whenever I want to feel feminine I reach for this. Opening notes can be quite strong initially but give it a few minutes and it mellows beautifully. 21st March 2015153430Colin MaillardShow all reviewsJ'adore is one of those modern classics we may take for granted: it's solid, always pleasant in pretty much any circumstance, stylish yet undemanding and carefree. A soapy-fruity blend with a fresh, invigorating opening of bergamot notes and peach, then white flowers, vanilla, a silky and clean jasmine deprived of its earthy-indolicness, with a beautiful crystalline rose note on a mellow base of sweet sandalwood and discreet cedar. All perfectly rounded and made a bit more adult by aldehydes and darker floral notes (tuberose). A fruity-powdery scent, if you want: a bit conventional and not a wow, probably, but with a really pleasant and cozy fresh, golden, white-plushy sense of liveliness, this making it quite appealing also for younger audiences. Yet it is also rich, slightly shady if you pay attention, with a thin feel of something more adult and sensual floating all over. Classy and cheerful. Not memorable, probably, and not the most distinctive scent around, but not all scents have to be like that; J'adore is a timeless, perfect, carefree and safe scent which can make pretty much any woman (or man) smell elegant, discreetly confident, generically sophisticated with a hint of urban-young allure in pretty much any situation. One of the several mainstream scents far superior to niche floral ones which rip them off at twice the price. Recommended! 7,5-8/10 24th November 2014148939L'homme vertShow all reviews*This review pertains to the original 'parfum' version circa 2000, the earlier extrait of J'Adore is more complex, verdant & lacks the syrupy sweetness found in later re-formulations, also the florals & raw materials used are of superb quality, a beautifully blended fragrance indeed, absolutely breathtaking !This would have to be the very best version of J'Adore available, one of Calice Beckers greatest creations. The original parfum contains both Maroc and Turkish rose, Ch.magnolia absolute, jasmine abs. (Grasse), Comoros ylang ylang & damas plum with a base of rare woods including high quality sandal and amaranth. Not as sweet as the more recent eau de parfum & toilette presentations including it's associated flankers although silage & staying power is phenomenal, projects well when used in combination with the lesser concentrations &/or a moisturizing body product (best when layered). The high quality florals are beautifully blended along with the Chinese magnolia and Cassis bud, this parfum imparts a luxurious silky feel on skin & is both a joy to apply & wear, I'm not sure if this 1999 formula is still being produced (highly unlikely), either way I would suggest searching for and stocking up if possible on this glittering gem of modern perfumery. Get it now while you still can, it's not that easily found so you may need to hunt it down, I guard my supplies zealously. . .It is certainly worth the effort, liquid 'GOLD' !\"Bon Chance\". . . 20th July 2014144068WingieShow all reviewsThis review is for the original formulation, sold in 1999. There is a difference!The original version, sold in 1999, is very good; a classic for its era, which was largely an era of fruity-florals. The J'Adore that is being sold in stores today is crap. Pure crap. I think the distinguishment between the two needs to be made because there are reviews of what seem to be the current version saying it smells like house cleaner, shampoo, soap, etc, which is true. J'Adore has been reformulated - more than once I believe - with detrimental results. But the original formulation is good, one of the best fruity-florals to come out of the 1990s. It can still be found on ebay, the box shows the Christian Dior label in a purple circle instead of a gold one. It is on my wishlist as a collector's item because I know one day it will no longer be available. Samples of the older version can also be found at Surrender to Chance. Even if you smell the current version and like it, I encourage you to seek out the original version. To me there is no point owning the current stuff when the real McCoy can still be had and is miles better.Pros: A classic; one of the best in the fruity-floral category.Cons: The original formula can only be found today on ebay.\" 23rd August 2013131240DiamondflameShow all reviewsA clean mildly soapy floral. J'ADORE is not particularly interesting but it is rather well made. And I cannot deny its delicately feminine girl-next-door charms. I think it makes a perfectly versatile fragrance for long summer days. 27th March 2012107899Wee Scottish Scent LoverShow all reviewsNo matter how many other perfumes I fall in love with, I never fall out of love with J'Adore. It is just overwhelmingly feminine and beautiful. I think it's the only fragrance which I still love in spite of the fact so many others wear it. It is the essence of summer time, yet it suits all seasons. In my opinion it is the most elegant of scents, not trying to be anything it isn't, just a perfect formulation of jasmine and rose, and it will always have a welcome place in my boudoir! 16th March 2012106740noirdrakkarShow all reviewsMale perspective: This is by far the best perfume that I ever smelled. 20th December 2011102289miss millsShow all reviewsCharming, infinitely feminine and very floral and clean smelling. I have such mixed feelings for this perfume as it is the one my best friend wore for years and years and I would buy it for her birthday - she passed away so tragically and suddenly last winter that (I feel so emotional just writing this much) now that I have her used bottles that she left behind, the ones I gave to her, every time I smell it I am overcome with longing for my friend to still be here.I will buy a purse sized J'Adore to remind me of her always. It was never the scent for me, I am definitely more of a Hypnotic Poison gal but an occasional dab will help keep my precious Cherylee forever alive to me.27th September 201198105LeilahdancerShow all reviewsWell, now. I've worn J'Adore EDP for a few years now, but I have only recently begun to expand my understanding of fragrance. I really wish the notes were listed for this, because I'm sure my ignorant nose will miss all the good stuff!I like the opening with fresh, white flowers and bit of soap. The middle came on as quite soapy and I don't like it quite as well. The dry down though... that I love. A little musk with some floral and hint of fresh baked cookie.The sillage has been perfect, so far. I've only had it on for three hours now. We'll see how the longevity goes.My new education tells me I still like this, but I wish the middle was less soapy. 7th September 201197032queen_shebaShow all reviewsI'm so sad others don't feel the same way as me about J'Adore. I \"adore\" this fragrance - every time I smell, either the top, heart or base notes I am charmed by its elegance.Its sillage is excellent, the basenotes are delicious and it just radiates femininity to me. I feel a million dollars wearing it. The way it develops on my skin is just perfect.It's one of my next to purchase! 20th June 201193096lady loveShow all reviewsThis is just one of the best perfumes of all time. I can't live without one bottle of Jadore, cuz is the essence of true elegance.Sweet, soft, feminine, sophisticated, and with a long power lasting without being overwhelming. Everybody know this perfume is a new classic. 28th January 201183867foetidusShow all reviewsFresh, floral, and fruity. The opening of the scent has a clear, balanced, and refined fruitiness that coordinates beautifully with the florals of the middle. The middle mixed florals carry those same kinds of balance and refinement that the fruit notes have, and that is, basically, the strong point of this fragrance: it does not have a strong single identifiable characteristic except that it is so beautifully combined of wonderfully complementary notes. Although it does lack a distinct personality, it would be almost impossible for J'Adore to be disagreeable. It is safe–it shows taste and refinement if not uniqueness. I think it might have been taken as an inspiration for Vera Wang for Men. 3rd December 201079957mysolegiaShow all reviewsThe EDP is strong stuff, use sparingly otherwise you'll get a headache.I like this fragrance, especially in the late spring early summer months. It hasn't attracted bees to my wrists so that's especially a plus for me. I detect a honey-amber base to it, which I find intriguing, identifiable and IMO unusual. Would I purchase a bottle of it? Not likely, but it's a gift that I wouldn't mind getting and using. Nicely done. 28th May 201056230shoegal68Show all reviewsLove this and that's all there is to it, it's pretty, there I said it...

It mostly reminded me of shampoo, and it was OK, but nothing great. It got very screechy on me, and veered into headache territory pretty easily. Gorgeous bottle, boring juice. 27th September 20202342632nosedtwinShow all reviewsJ'Adore - Christian DiorAfter a watery-fruity start this thing quickly swifts into a evenly fruity-floral (peach-plum-apricot-banana vs rose-muguet) fuzzy waxy tonality with something that reminds me of the fattiness of sheepwool, which I like very much. It gets elevated into a luscious summery seebreeze airyness with whiffs of wood glue and tealeaves which gives it a rough edged feel. At some point it had me thinking of a water-downed version of Allure pour homme. A central jasmine-ylangylang combo gets dragged into the dryout and gives it a syrupy plummy sweetness and as contrast, a suprising dark bitter-sour accent of blackberry. It further develops a kind of 'dewed' vanilla and white musk-amber tone with slightly burned plastic/rubbery undertones and a sharp soapy feel. All in all the whole perfume smells a bit too chemical and crude. Not bad but also not very original, a slightly Dior-unworthy perfume. 17th June 2019217841ADVERTISEMENTBal a VersaillesShow all reviewsThis review is for J'Adore Touche, given to me as a 1 ml sample. It's a muskier version of Jardins de Bagatelle, tuberose rich and the rest all thrown in. Nothing new here but very nice. 29th November 2016179346rskookydoughShow all reviewsMy daughter received this as a gift from a new boyfriend. He did not know her very well because this is not for her. She thinks this scent is old lady. I don't know were that is coming from. I seen a review on this that said it smells good on paper. That hits the nail right on the head. I wanted to like this because it is so pretty and floral. It ends up just smelling waxy after a few hours on my skin. 22nd October 2015163222IzzieShow all reviewsIt's a pleasant fragrance, it really is, but there is nothing really interesting about it. It smells like shampoo, to me. And I like the way most shampoo smells, so I'm not saying it's off-putting, there's just nothing particularly unique about it. It's one of those fragrances that I would have a hard time pointing out if I came across someone wearing it. I get as far as \"that smells nice\", but I can't pinpoint anything specific or particular about it that makes me go \"oh, yeah, that's J'Adore\"That said, it is clean, inoffensive, easy to wear, feminine and \"pretty\". Probably great for women out there who aren't particularly interested in fragrances beyond wanting to smell good and inoffensive. But to someone who's smelled a lot of fragrances, this is dull, uninspired and common. 6th January 2013122330emelleShow all reviewsit is for young women i think. it is really innocent and lovely .it is clean and sweet and shy.i really rocemmend this perfume .but i can't say it is for me now.i am seeking something that is more ambitious and brave. i used to have this but i don't want to have this any more. 4th July 2012113096trikkirikkiShow all reviewsI really want to like this. It's fine on paper, the notes should work really well together, and I love this type of fragrance in general. But when it hits my skin nothing happens. It smells the same throughout, from top to base. The plum gets sticky sweet on my skin, and there is nothing there to balance it out. Maybe its just chemistry. It's still pleasant enough, but dull, so dull. Everyday wear for someone else, not for me. 4th January 2012102913DarvantShow all reviewsThe J'Adore dry down, with its rosey and slightly fruity-soapy multifaceted floral wake, is a sort of veritable redemption for a scent that starts somewhat uninteresting with a watery (almost aquatic) orangy-irony laundry feel (aroused by citrus and ylang-ylang in a way that evokes, with its angular trait, the intense lily of the valley presence on the side of citrus) and evolves towards a middle phase that is deeply floral due to a valzer of rose, jasmine and tuberose. The juice is fresh and joyful, sensual and dynamic, dry and changeful. The musky vanilla of the base is delicate and well balanced in order to introduce a touch of smoothness and to amalgamate the complexity of the floral notes. Nothing  bad with this renowned juice but it's simply not the kind of fragrance i rave for. 16th December 2011148936Dame PigletShow all reviewsAbrasive top notes dry down to Dial soap scent on me. My friends have all remarked that \"it's not bad, but smells like cheap perfume.\" On someone with different chemistry it may be wonderful. I detect no fruit in the fragrance at all. 20th May 201191550blood-orangeShow all reviewsI must say I was rather surprised by this fragrance. By just looking at the bottle, the advertisements and the overall love that people have for this, I was expecting your typical floral that smells comforting, yet so much like Grandma. I was quite astounded by its fruity notes when I first sprayed J'adore. It wasn't a horrid blast of citrus or overly sweetened fruits, it was more subdued and sophisticated. If I had to pick a fragrance that was similar in its composition, elegance and style, I would say Miss Dior Cherie is rather similar. The scent itself is indeed very strong, but for me that is a quality that I enjoy in my perfumes. It definitely, in my opinion, has the potential to be a very seductive and sexy fragrance, as I have heard that many men prefer fruity scents on their women. I believe that this scent would be signature worthy because it is not something that I can imagine someone tiring of quickly. Although best suited to special occasions and nightwear, I can imagine this being worn as a casual fragrance. I believe that its versatility relies on how much scent you apply to your skin. Remember that less is more when you use J'adore.26th April 201190308MizzalotShow all reviewsI really love the scent of this perfume! Sophisticated, original, feminine, classy,...Unfortunately it fades away very quickly on my skin.Too bad... 20th December 201081113LorettagraceShow all reviewsWarm, fresh. A little soapy, at least on my skin. Reminds me a little bit of Sensuous by Estee Lauder -- at least, in the way that it's warm smelling. I get more freshness than sweetness. I don't get any fruit at all -- I'm not sure why anyone would smell fruit on this, but I know chemistry is weird. There's nothing unpleasant about it, but nothing really great either. Maybe it's just not my style. 29th December 200974169pinkfizzyShow all reviewsCitrussy peachy rose. I have a sample of EdP and it's so watery and weak I could have sworn it was cologne or EdT. I would have liked it more if they'd amped up the peach and rose a bit more and fleshed it out a bit. And it gave me a rash.But it's not bad for a modern fruity floral. Much classier than most of them out there nowadays. 15th September 200969873cjkammShow all reviewsA pretty floral scent, nothing different or daring. Reminds me of Tresor. 15th July 200971353NostalgieShow all reviewsThis is a fruity floral, with the peach and rose standing out most for me. If it were color it would be the peachy pink of some excellent dry French rosés. A very fresh, almost (but not quite) sophisticated non-bold floral. It starts out a bit too fruity but calms down some. A little more bright than I like my perfumes, but very nice and wearable.The dry down is soft and cheerful. I can't say I adore it. But it's nice. Just nice. Attractive bottle design. 10th July 200960500mikey_pShow all reviewsThis is an acceptable quality fresh floral but nothing particularly interesting. The Absolu version boosts the florals so much more beautifully, that this version seems oddly redundant. 11th June 200914565AshaShow all reviewsDior J'AdoreNotes: mandarin, champaca flowers, ivy, african orchid, rose, violet, damascus plum, amaranth wood, blackberry musk (from Sephora)I never smelled J'Adore before, and had always read it is a peachy floral. I can't say I am disappointed--there is indeed some very juicy peach and a soft, powdery rose which turns bitter and \"perfumy\" later in the development. The fragrance is quite pleasant, although the rose presentation reminds me of an old-fashioned rose fragrance. If it weren't for the peach note, the rose would deteriorate into a sickly rose soliflore, the kind that gives rose a bad name in perfumery. Yet, there is a familiar comfort to this fragrance--the fruit and floral are not candy-like, and the powder is not sweet. J'Adore is sophisticated and evokes a confident maturity. The peach and rose die down into the middle portion of the fragrance, letting the other mixed florals come forth. But, the peach never really stops--it stays in the background to give a cushioned framework for the florals to settle. This is well and truly a feminine composition. I am not bowled over by it, but I do marvel at the composure this fragrance has, and how it has a calming effect on my mood. Dior J'Adore L'Eau Cologne Florale (2009 release)Notes: bergamot, magnolia, neroli (from NowSmellThis)Who put Miss Dior Cherie into my J'Adore? At first spray, I smelled soft and light notes of watery peach and grapefruit in a cloud of soft florals. It smells GREAT on paper. On my skin, the fresh and slightly biting grapefruit note turn bitter in the same way that Miss Dior Cherie has a bitter, medicinal edge. It is as if I failed to correctly swallow an aspirin, was left with a terrible taste in my mouth, and attempts to wash it down with fruit punch did not work. Thankfully, later in the development, the fragrance tempers a bit. The peach and floral notes stay prominent well into the drydown, reminding me that this is indeed J'Adore and not necessarily a hollow version of itself. I wonder though--who is it that thinks if you add a dose of acidic or sour smelling notes, that a fragrance suddenly becomes \"light and fresh\"? I must admit, J'Adore L'Eau is not really unpleasant in any way. However, I am having a hard time accepting that the original, composed and calm J'Adore can be easily converted into a fresher version by adding the olfactory equivalent of Vitamin C. Was the original not fresh enough? Alas, I am sucked in by the modern, sparkly quality J'Adore L'Eau has. It fits my idea of a clean, fruity, floral and slightly soapy fragrance done in the contemporary style. 11th May 200950084marmaldeskyShow all reviewsThis just smells so...90s. I realize that it came out in 1999, but it smells like something every woman my mother's age wore in the 1990s. It isn't bad, and I might wear it at some point (Sephora sent me three samples of J'Adore in a bonus sample grab bag gift) but it's so reminiscent as to be distracting. It's just not me I guess. 10th November 200861552sugarplum123Show all reviewsI thought that this smelled very sophisticated but it's probably designed for older women. As a teenager, i would not wear this scent as it feels too overpowering. 16th October 200862017HORACIO GONZÁLEZShow all reviewsnot bad but a little offensive, how to say, just a little invasive, sorry 31st August 200838435purplebird7Show all reviewsIt would take an army to steer me away from my favorite Dior fragrance, Miss Dior. (No, I take that back--if they reformulate it any more, I will refuse to buy it again.) Apparently my tastes do not agree with the masses. J'Adore is popular. Indeed, it is pleasant, and I can see why so many people like it. This genre of light, fruity florals is not my favorite. There are too many silly, simple ones. I wonder if most people wear them because they missed the chance to try anything better. For a fruity floral, I think Geir Ness Laila is more interesting. This is a Norweigan perfume of \"mountain wildflowers\" and a watermelon note, made with no synthetics--pretty amazing. I'll leave J'adore to the masses. 25th April 200826171AmberflashShow all reviewssmells pretty.... but it's the poster child I'd say for boring, run-of-the-mill fruity florals. Doesn't smell cheap and has a pleasant composition, so it's a safe one to wear to the office or an interview, maybe, or anywhere you want to appear sophisticated without appearing altogether original. 7th May 200739000tmgp24Show all reviewsthis used to be my favorite perfume.i got it when it first came out in 1999.the last 2 bottles i bought(within 4 month period)have not smelled right.i brought them back to dillard's and the clerks and manager all said that the perfume smelled sour.i will not be buying it any more.nice thing was they gave me a bottle of miss dior cherie and organza to takes it's place(plus a bunch of samples) 3rd March 200738113sherrie11Show all reviewsI enjoy most of the Dior fragrances. J'Adore is a very *nice* fragrance but it doesn't knock my socks off. Maybe that's a good thing - there's always room in my wardrobe for a *nice* generic fragrance to wear to a funeral or christening or something. (!!) \"Generic\" is too extreme, though. J'Adore is not quite generic, but it's not special with a capital \"S\", though I do like it. I love the bottle. 29th October 20062072112 Next Most reviews in the last weekColbourne (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (4)landshark321 (3)exmin (3)speedracer (3)RoamingRose (3)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)epapsiou (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (28)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)Varanis Ridari (8)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)Zgb (7)Lian (7)sjg3839 (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

Almost nauseating and the price is really too excessive. There are better perfumes that are much cheaper. 13th April 2021241503marimariShow all reviewsBought a 5 ml sample to test-drive it. Too sharp, floral and sweet and very expensive for such a vulgar fragrance. Reminds me of the cheap fragrances by Avon. You would expect something at least 10 times better from Dior. Tacky, for people with no taste at all, who are happy to spend gobs of money to show off their expendable wealth. The first image that comes to my mind after smelling it is of a bunch of nouveau riche moms in their late 30's meeting inside an elevator at a condo while going for a tea around the center table showing off their perfumes to each other and commenting about their prices. 28th February 2018198460ADVERTISEMENTjepifishShow all reviewsWhat a horribly tacky scent -- cloying and excessively saccharine; I hated it from the first spritz, but by God is it difficult to get rid of. There's no personality, just constant sweetness, like opening a packet of stale, powdered doughnuts. 31st December 2017195888CookBotShow all reviewsA Snuggle dryer sheet that's been used to wipe down a potted faux rosebush with an anonymous white musk shampoo.J'Adios.20th September 2017191575Way Off ScenterShow all reviewsGenre: Fruity FloralAny fruity floral scent joining a line that already includes Diorella needs to be a lot better than J'Adore to justify its existence. Calice Becker's floral compositions sometimes take on an overly abstract, almost faceless quality. This is true to some degree of Beyond Paradise, but very much the case with J'Adore. There's nothing particularly wrong with J'Adore's lactonic peachy floral accord, but it never smells more than bland and sweet to me. There's none of the crisp, cheerful green tea that enlivens Becker's Tommy Girl, nor any of the luxurious tuberose that elevates J'Adore's l'Absolut version. For me , though, the ultimate deal-breaker is a white musk drydown that's a dead ringer for my current shampoo. (Kérastase Resistance.) I think I can live without J'Adore.2014:Either I've become less tolerant with age, or J'Adore's formula has been cheapened. I now find the fruity notes at J'Adore's heart unpleasantly cloying.18th June 2014143392masamim10Show all reviewsReally wanted to love this... but all I detect is powder, powder, and... powder. It makes me want to sneeze! Sorry, must not be for me. Seeing the popularity of this scent, I assume it probably smells better on the people it works on than in the bottle. 16th March 2014136789Mufta MammaShow all reviewsUnlike Wingie, I wasn't fortunate enough to obtain a sample of the original scent, but I whole-heartedly agree that the newer J'Adore is terrible. It's an overpowering concoction of Ylang-Ylang, musk, and some foul fixative. I reserve single-star reviews for fragrances that contain the formic-acid-scented fixitives found in the cheapest of colognes and perfumes. This fragrance nearly obtained that dubious honor. 31st January 2014134954CricketkittyShow all reviewsI know I am in the minority here, but I think this stinks. If you like \"clean\" fragrances this is for you, because to me it smells like something you would clean your house with. 2nd September 2012115992Mimi GardeniaShow all reviewsThree notes listed on dior.com- ylang ylang, damask rose and jasmine sambac. Well ,we all know there is much more to J'Adore than those three notes. What about the champaca ?? I find it interesting that on the Dior website, their olfactory notes section doesn't tell us more than three notes for each scent. Dear Dior.com People, do you think that we ,the general public , are unable to process the idea of more than three notes at a time ???Personally I dislike that elongated bottle neck a lot . Personally, I don't know how J'Adore stays so popular as to be No 1 on the bestseller lists. Be prepared for negativity in this little review /sampling note . Apologies to all who love this scent. Believe me, my life would be much simpler and my wallet fatter, if I also loved this scent more than others ! Today I was obsessed with re sniffing J'Adore. I don't know how The Fragrance Demons attack me in the night that I awake with such a desire to re sniff something I already know, I am not very fond of to begin with ! Off to Cow Town Mall I went.J'Adore EDP is beautiful to begin with . There is a classical glow at first with such a blend of jasmine , rose and ylang ylang that I get this peachiness. It's like 'diffusive silk' . I love my peach so this was good smelling so far. J'Adore at this point is pretty and swoon worthy . It does seem to present some kind of olfactory picture of \" Gold\" . I thought to myself \" I don't remember J'Adore smelling this romantic and gorgeous. \"Fast forward to the drydown . This is where my problem with J'Adore occurs. I come across this nose WALL block - perhaps it's the fruity blackberry ,perhaps violets and musk combo that really is awful on me. It's like wet cardboard - dank ,screechy ,artificial and this is the character smell of J'Adore I always associate with it. Too bad. The opening of J'Adore is gorgeous and the drydown is like some schizoid character on my skin. That schizoid character just loves to hang around . Hours later and I am smelling seriously of cardboard. it sits right here on my arm and firmly in my poor nose. It could be worse, J'Adore Eau de Cardboard could've given me a migraine but it doesn't. For this, it gets ' un point '.If I had not waited till the dry down and bought J'Adore on the spot based on that silky waft of peachy-rose-jasmine , I would have been upset .That wall block of offensiveness at the dry down - such a chemical spill on my skin - would have made me take my purchase right back to Cow Town Mall for my refund. 10th June 2012111970MinkymaidShow all reviewsPeach, rose, soap, safe. Saying anything unpleasant about this scent feels like shouting at a teddy bear - who could be so mean? However, the image of nice mummies having lunch while the washing machine spins in the background springs to mind. I find this a cloying scent lying over fresh laundered clothes. Thousands like it, but its just not for me. 4th February 2012104381katk925Show all reviewsI really loved this when I sprayed it on the card but when I finally tried it on my skin I got the same gross soap undertone the person below me said. EWWW 14th June 201192839GrottolaShow all reviewsI hate to jump on the negative bandwagon here, but add me to the chorus that thinks J'Adore smells like a shampoo. It's a fruity-floral that doesn't necessarily smell cheap, just shampoo-like. 17th February 201185285GelbeDominoShow all reviewsI am so very tempted to write a review that just says \"Blech!\" but I won't.I am sampling the EDP: it smells cheap and cloying, like pear candy at first and like shampoo as it dries down. It is making my nostrils ache. Honest.Not complex at all, which isn't a bad thing in itself.Simple scents can be nice (I enjoy my Rosines and Goutals, after all) but when they are executed in a more delicate and sophisticated way than this.If you want to smell like pear candy and shampoo, well, stop at the candy store and wash your hair. 3rd February 201184380jimmyguoShow all reviewsAbout as mass-market a female fragrance can become. I am completely unable to distinguish any of the singular floral notes (where's the champaca?) other than a starkly synthetic rose accord. Basically, it smells like some cheap hair product and nothing like the refined french luxury Dior is trying to sell us. 5th January 201182063BetsyMeszarosShow all reviewsI tried it for the first time yesterday. It's so bad I don't even know where to begin. I just don't get it. 29th September 201079067LiveJazzShow all reviewsSo, I am the second person in a row to think J'Adore smells like shampoo. And no, I didn't read Off-Scenter's review before I smelled it. It doesn't smell bad. I guess I just don't see the point. I expect much more from Dior. 8th July 201022662Jean Patou FanShow all reviewsI really couldn't believe J'Adore when I first tried it: brash and aggressive, it smells more like hair lacquer than fine perfume. I'm sorry I really can't find anything positive to say about J'Adore. Nasty and aggressive, it gives me an instant headache 29th March 201074809CarrieShow all reviewsA screamingly overpowering floral that screams and shouts in bright, glaring lights. Too loud; an unrefined scent that heads straight for the pit of your stomach. 5th November 200973871PrometheaShow all reviewsYuck. If I was trying this blind, I would have guessed this a very cheap perfume indeed. A nasty, synthetic, almost metallic peach smell dominates this when sniffing it on my wrist. Sillage is apparently impressive - my flatmate recoiled at the smell from a distance of 12 feet to ask in polite disgust what on earth I was wearing. And that from one small spay to my wrist. Closer examination of the scent from said flatmate elicted the further opinion that the scent at close quarters smelled like BO being covered by cheap scent. Not a keeper. 2nd February 200965239TrufflesShow all reviewsThis smells exactly like some dirt-cheap Spanish perfume I smelled while on holiday as a teenager about 20 years ago. So basically I'm not a fan and with the exception of Midnight Poison I don't as a rule like Dior perfumes anyway. 20th October 200862067takemyhusbandplzShow all reviewsSorry, but my first impression was to run away from the awful stench.

It mostly reminded me of shampoo, and it was OK, but nothing great. It got very screechy on me, and veered into headache territory pretty easily. Gorgeous bottle, boring juice. 27th September 2020234263ADVERTISEMENTVaranis RidariShow all reviewsNormally I'm not one to really get into fruity florals. There are exceptions, but by and large it is a very bland and ubiquitous genre served up to women in the same capacity as aquatics are to men. There really is only so much you can do with fruit and flowers before it smells like your average dryer sheet or salon product, but when an exception occurs, it strikes an accord with me that allows me to appreciate what can be done within the narrow purview of the category when it's done right. J'Adore by Dior (1999) is one such exception, and was originally composed by the phenomenal Calice Becker for Dior before François Demachy took up the mantle as house perfumer for the brand. To put things in perspective, it had been years since a new solid pillar took hold in the female perfume realm for the house. There was the doorbuster Poison (1985) created by Jean Guichard back in the 80's, with several flankers released in the years since which tried to tame the beast it was, then Dune (1991) showed up and brought some weird animal musk and sandy windswept florals together but without much fanfare, and finally Dolce Vita (1995) which proved to be successful, but not the generalist Dior needed to replace Poison as the flagship feminine. J'Adore ended up being that flagship for the brand because it was simple, well-crafted, and was more than the sum of its fruity floral parts, showing that a great perfume doesn't need costly ingredients or avant-garde style, just amazing execution within the given medium. Much like Chanel Cristalle (1974), J'Adore remains bouncy, lively, and fresh without being overly sweet. Granted, J'Adore is miles away happier than the icy bitch that is Cristalle, a sort of equal opposite if you will, but it presents its case earnestly. The opening of J'Adore is balmy calone shimmer as is expected from a 90's fragrance, but here it works as a pear and mandarin note creep in to join. This tropical sunset of a fragrance moves into lily of the valley after a while, with jasmine sambac in the heart, alongside a light plum and rose water combo that keeps things pretty and feminine without being super sweet or powdery. There is that galoxide shampoo smell here too that you either love or hate in perfumes like this, something also likened to the aforementioned dryer sheets, but here it just really sets the tone of the fragrance rather than dominates it, and I'm not one to hate on the use of synthetic aromachemicals if they are wielded with some skill. If the presence alone of modern scent molecules was enough to make me throw in the towel, I might as well resort to making my own perfumes or just buying from the oud dudes or attar makers online. There is a white musk along with some Iso E Super and dusting of cedar in the base, but the overall accord is held up with the chemicals so you get isolated pear and jasmine over rosewater for hours and hours, without anything like a traditional sandalwood or oakmoss base for any of this to mull into like a traditional chypre. J'Adore feels very linear for this reason but it was made at a time when linear is what people wanted; a single great-smelling accord from start to finish with no surprises to apologize for later on, unlike most of our beloved niche perfumes or heady complex vintage powerhouses with Baskin Robbin's 31 flavors of animal sac. As a generalist, J'Adore has the gumption to stand up in hot or cold, casual or work occasions, romantic liaisons and family gatherings, but does stumble some in formal situations where a \"happy\" scent might be off-putting to strangers. Wear time of the original eau de parfum is essentially all day, and sillage more than adequate, so this is no weak-sauce watery perfume despite the style in which it sits. The person who adores J'Adore is going to be that coworker or boss who just wants a shining beacon of fragrance to announce their arrival and linger just long enough after they've left to let everyone know they've been there if they weren't around to meet them when they showed up, but not necessarily to alarm anyone in the process. J'Adore disarms the person who enters its cloud, as it is oh so very clean, fresh, not sweet enough to cloy or impart a feeling of immaturity and mischief, but not dry or austere enough to command you to be on your guard. J'Adore is a \"good feeling\" fragrance when you don't want to be too exciting but also don't want to blend in with everyone's lavender fougère or orange blossom white floral. The fact that this is such an immaculate example of a maligned all-too-common genre in women's perfume is the one reason it remains so popular; this smells incredibly familiar yet better than most of the things you're liable to happen upon in the street when passing women (and some men) wearing these types of perfumes. I'd say this leans mostly feminine due to the heavy pear and jasmine sambac notes, but anyone with tastes for these notes could wear it, especially in the modern unisex niche perfume market. J'Adore gets pretty pricey for a designer, so definitely test first, and has a half-dozen iterations to boot, but if you're going to own just one fruity floral, it's hard to do better without going further back in time. Good deals do pop up from time to time, and that iconic bottle just looks so great sitting in a collection, with it's wound brass topper crowned with whatever that faux pearl is made of, that even niche snobs would have a difficult time begrudging you for adding it to your collection. Just a hard fragrance overall to dislike! Thumbs up! 4th August 20192195512nosedtwinShow all reviewsJ'Adore - Christian DiorAfter a watery-fruity start this thing quickly swifts into a evenly fruity-floral (peach-plum-apricot-banana vs rose-muguet) fuzzy waxy tonality with something that reminds me of the fattiness of sheepwool, which I like very much. It gets elevated into a luscious summery seebreeze airyness with whiffs of wood glue and tealeaves which gives it a rough edged feel. At some point it had me thinking of a water-downed version of Allure pour homme. A central jasmine-ylangylang combo gets dragged into the dryout and gives it a syrupy plummy sweetness and as contrast, a suprising dark bitter-sour accent of blackberry. It further develops a kind of 'dewed' vanilla and white musk-amber tone with slightly burned plastic/rubbery undertones and a sharp soapy feel. All in all the whole perfume smells a bit too chemical and crude. Not bad but also not very original, a slightly Dior-unworthy perfume. 17th June 2019217841marimariShow all reviewsBought a 5 ml sample to test-drive it. Too sharp, floral and sweet and very expensive for such a vulgar fragrance. Reminds me of the cheap fragrances by Avon. You would expect something at least 10 times better from Dior. Tacky, for people with no taste at all, who are happy to spend gobs of money to show off their expendable wealth. The first image that comes to my mind after smelling it is of a bunch of nouveau riche moms in their late 30's meeting inside an elevator at a condo while going for a tea around the center table showing off their perfumes to each other and commenting about their prices. 28th February 2018198460jepifishShow all reviewsWhat a horribly tacky scent -- cloying and excessively saccharine; I hated it from the first spritz, but by God is it difficult to get rid of. There's no personality, just constant sweetness, like opening a packet of stale, powdered doughnuts. 31st December 2017195888HouseOfPhlegethonShow all reviewsA very fruity floral. Tons of fruit, in fact. Sharp floral mix, in the middle. It ends with vanilla and blackberry. Sweet spring or summer concoction. 3rd December 2017194794CookBotShow all reviewsA Snuggle dryer sheet that's been used to wipe down a potted faux rosebush with an anonymous white musk shampoo.J'Adios.20th September 2017191575Possum-PieShow all reviewsLight airy floral/fruit frag. Has a bit of a lipstick drydown. Nice overall summer fragrance. 22nd July 2017189170Bal a VersaillesShow all reviewsThis review is for J'Adore Touche, given to me as a 1 ml sample. It's a muskier version of Jardins de Bagatelle, tuberose rich and the rest all thrown in. Nothing new here but very nice. 29th November 2016179346odysseusmShow all reviewsA pretty, cheery and subtle floral. Slightly sweet but shows good taste. Light, nothing heavy here. Cute, clean and fun. If lightly applied it sits close to the skin and indeed becomes a good, somewhat sexy skin scent for a woman. 12th November 2016178873justchekinoutShow all reviewsI thought it would be another clean-smelling scent that doesn't stand out from a bunch of other scents from people on the streets, but it turns out that I haven't got bored of the scent after wearing it for two months! Maybe the chemistry really works well with the weather of the city I currently live in--hot and humid--and this white-floral scent makes me feel so refreshed every time I wear it. Recommend for spring and summer. 3rd July 2016173951CocoFlankerShow all reviewsI'm a sucker for everything jasmine-tuberose, but what made me keep this one -which I understand is the love/hate note- is the pear note, and what I love the most is the drydown. J'adore is an amazing blend of delicate and sweet, but also vibrant and sexy soft floral, fruity, musky notes.At first I felt the fruity note a bit sharp to the point of making my eyes itchy, but after an hour or so, the musky drydown made me fell for it.Let me put it this way: at first, it's a glamorous post-shower clean, but then it mutates into a flapper girl with a glass of sweet summer white wine in hand, lounging by the pool.I feel I can wear this -I acually do, as a matter of fact- with jeans+white top and I feel dressed. It's a summer scent, perfect for casual wear, night or day. Lasts about 8 hours on my skin. 8th April 2016170443KotoriShow all reviewsI don't think this is for me, because it is very popular, and very floral. However, I tried it on my skin for the first time today after years of passing it by without a thought, and there is something old-world feminine about it. There is a classic structure reminiscent of Diorella and Mitsouko, but with a brighter, more linear effect. It is sunny without being shrill. On the card, the ylang ylang and tuberose screech. On my skin, however, the fruit ripens, and I get a mezzo-soprano voice with mellow vibrato and a hint of dark edges. I think I could wear this. I understand what people say when they say it smells like shampoo, but I think that's a chicken-or-egg issue. I think J'Adore must've inspired some of the functional perfumery in the last decade and a half since its release. 22nd November 2015164562OviattShow all reviewsThis is fine French perfumery brought up to date--feminine, sunny and chic, this is a perfect representation of the brand as it is today--a (perhaps THE) great couture house, still relevant in the current day. A fruity floral with Ylang, rose, jasmine and tuberose, lightened by aldehydes and anchored with sandalwood, this is a textbook composition done right. Does it shout for attention? Does it stand out in a crowd? No, but a woman wearing J'Adore will always be one of the best smelling women in the room. Wonderful packaging and marketing, with the beautiful Charlize Theron, sunny, chic and feminine herself, perfectly representing this lovely offering from the House of Dior. 29th October 2015163542rskookydoughShow all reviewsMy daughter received this as a gift from a new boyfriend. He did not know her very well because this is not for her. She thinks this scent is old lady. I don't know were that is coming from. I seen a review on this that said it smells good on paper. That hits the nail right on the head. I wanted to like this because it is so pretty and floral. It ends up just smelling waxy after a few hours on my skin. 22nd October 2015163222clamnoleShow all reviewsMy wife owns this fragrance, and along with Miss Dior they are both my all time favorites. J'Adore is just so sweet and subtle. The floral notes are perfectly light. J'Adore makes me very happy when I detect it on my wife. It's light and draws me in and I always want to get close to her to smell it on her skin. A perfect fragrance for a happy marriage IMO. 12th May 2015156264MmcleanShow all reviewsThis fragrance reminds me of a wedding day. Flowers everywhere and sun beaming in the church. It is floral sweet bouquet, pretty and elegant. Whenever I want to feel feminine I reach for this. Opening notes can be quite strong initially but give it a few minutes and it mellows beautifully. 21st March 2015153430Colin MaillardShow all reviewsJ'adore is one of those modern classics we may take for granted: it's solid, always pleasant in pretty much any circumstance, stylish yet undemanding and carefree. A soapy-fruity blend with a fresh, invigorating opening of bergamot notes and peach, then white flowers, vanilla, a silky and clean jasmine deprived of its earthy-indolicness, with a beautiful crystalline rose note on a mellow base of sweet sandalwood and discreet cedar. All perfectly rounded and made a bit more adult by aldehydes and darker floral notes (tuberose). A fruity-powdery scent, if you want: a bit conventional and not a wow, probably, but with a really pleasant and cozy fresh, golden, white-plushy sense of liveliness, this making it quite appealing also for younger audiences. Yet it is also rich, slightly shady if you pay attention, with a thin feel of something more adult and sensual floating all over. Classy and cheerful. Not memorable, probably, and not the most distinctive scent around, but not all scents have to be like that; J'adore is a timeless, perfect, carefree and safe scent which can make pretty much any woman (or man) smell elegant, discreetly confident, generically sophisticated with a hint of urban-young allure in pretty much any situation. One of the several mainstream scents far superior to niche floral ones which rip them off at twice the price. Recommended! 7,5-8/10 24th November 2014148939L'homme vertShow all reviews*This review pertains to the original 'parfum' version circa 2000, the earlier extrait of J'Adore is more complex, verdant & lacks the syrupy sweetness found in later re-formulations, also the florals & raw materials used are of superb quality, a beautifully blended fragrance indeed, absolutely breathtaking !This would have to be the very best version of J'Adore available, one of Calice Beckers greatest creations. The original parfum contains both Maroc and Turkish rose, Ch.magnolia absolute, jasmine abs. (Grasse), Comoros ylang ylang & damas plum with a base of rare woods including high quality sandal and amaranth. Not as sweet as the more recent eau de parfum & toilette presentations including it's associated flankers although silage & staying power is phenomenal, projects well when used in combination with the lesser concentrations &/or a moisturizing body product (best when layered). The high quality florals are beautifully blended along with the Chinese magnolia and Cassis bud, this parfum imparts a luxurious silky feel on skin & is both a joy to apply & wear, I'm not sure if this 1999 formula is still being produced (highly unlikely), either way I would suggest searching for and stocking up if possible on this glittering gem of modern perfumery. Get it now while you still can, it's not that easily found so you may need to hunt it down, I guard my supplies zealously. . .It is certainly worth the effort, liquid 'GOLD' !\"Bon Chance\". . . 20th July 2014144068Way Off ScenterShow all reviewsGenre: Fruity FloralAny fruity floral scent joining a line that already includes Diorella needs to be a lot better than J'Adore to justify its existence. Calice Becker's floral compositions sometimes take on an overly abstract, almost faceless quality. This is true to some degree of Beyond Paradise, but very much the case with J'Adore. There's nothing particularly wrong with J'Adore's lactonic peachy floral accord, but it never smells more than bland and sweet to me. There's none of the crisp, cheerful green tea that enlivens Becker's Tommy Girl, nor any of the luxurious tuberose that elevates J'Adore's l'Absolut version. For me , though, the ultimate deal-breaker is a white musk drydown that's a dead ringer for my current shampoo. (Kérastase Resistance.) I think I can live without J'Adore.2014:Either I've become less tolerant with age, or J'Adore's formula has been cheapened. I now find the fruity notes at J'Adore's heart unpleasantly cloying.18th June 2014143392masamim10Show all reviewsReally wanted to love this... but all I detect is powder, powder, and... powder. It makes me want to sneeze! Sorry, must not be for me. Seeing the popularity of this scent, I assume it probably smells better on the people it works on than in the bottle. 16th March 2014136789Mufta MammaShow all reviewsUnlike Wingie, I wasn't fortunate enough to obtain a sample of the original scent, but I whole-heartedly agree that the newer J'Adore is terrible. It's an overpowering concoction of Ylang-Ylang, musk, and some foul fixative. I reserve single-star reviews for fragrances that contain the formic-acid-scented fixitives found in the cheapest of colognes and perfumes. This fragrance nearly obtained that dubious honor. 31st January 2014134954WingieShow all reviewsThis review is for the original formulation, sold in 1999. There is a difference!The original version, sold in 1999, is very good; a classic for its era, which was largely an era of fruity-florals. The J'Adore that is being sold in stores today is crap. Pure crap. I think the distinguishment between the two needs to be made because there are reviews of what seem to be the current version saying it smells like house cleaner, shampoo, soap, etc, which is true. J'Adore has been reformulated - more than once I believe - with detrimental results. But the original formulation is good, one of the best fruity-florals to come out of the 1990s. It can still be found on ebay, the box shows the Christian Dior label in a purple circle instead of a gold one. It is on my wishlist as a collector's item because I know one day it will no longer be available. Samples of the older version can also be found at Surrender to Chance. Even if you smell the current version and like it, I encourage you to seek out the original version. To me there is no point owning the current stuff when the real McCoy can still be had and is miles better.Pros: A classic; one of the best in the fruity-floral category.Cons: The original formula can only be found today on ebay.\" 23rd August 201313124012345 Next Most reviews in the last weekmanlyscents (8)Colbourne (8)Varanis Ridari (4)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)landshark321 (3)exmin (3)speedracer (3)RoamingRose (3)SPACEDOUT (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (28)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (8)Lian (7)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

To be honest not so much about Initio Parfums really catches my interest (none of their western-arabic bombastic aesthetic, the pompous Black Gold Project's \"inlaid\" bottles-style and the emphatic fragrances-\"denomination\"). Oud for Greatness is the Initio's prodigal son, one of the few really by me appreciated from the house and actually one of the most succesful western interpretations of the infamous oriental note of aoud (bold muskiness, aromatics, captivating mild spiciness, exotic far lands-aura, fairy tales-conjuration and authoritarian sensualism). Yes, Oud for Greatness is powerful on saffron, mild spices, patchouli, woods and ambergris but it is mostly something about it, His majesty King Oudh. The latter expresses in here many of the variegate nuances this infamous \"ingredient\" could magically unfold in a more western civilized spicy acception, being it in here at same time initially aromatic (freshly metallic spicy aromatic lavender), intoxocating (mild spices), boldly rubbery/medicinal (room cleaner/boots polish/dental detergent-like), woodsy and finally musky spicy with a musky-leathery final touch of ambergris and a subtle molecular brightness with all its dramatic theatricality and its power of sensual hypnosis (with its kind of \"wide\" laundry powdery and soapy exotic muskiness like the golden smell and the aromatic atmosphere of an orietal dreamy arabian hotel as in a fairy tale holiday from One Thousand and One Nights). This fragrance is initially a saffronic-rubbery-kind of incensey (dusty spices) \"neutral\" blast under my profane nose (it seems for a while to experience a sort of milder Durbano Black Tourmaline, since the spicy sweetness is on this phase effectively minimal). Saffron (surrounded by citric, rosey, metallic, herbal accents) is layed down a \"rich in sensualism\" bed of spicy musky western sweet molecular oud and balmy-leathery muskiness. Oud for greatness is in effects mainly a molecular sparkling accord of oud (turbulent and bursting but finally almost talky aromatic), aromatic lavender, mild intoxicating piquant \"metallic\" spices (as inebriating saffron, captivating nutmeg and cloves) and a bold patchouli. This is an hard to be faced accord really vibrant, dark, \"butch\", wide, encompassing and temperamental. Over the first intoxicating spray you are invested by a tornado of aromatic, molecular, kind of aldehydic and metallic spices joined by a sort of citric, medicinal, definitely rubbery and woody oudish surrection. Piquant dusty freshly-metallic spices gradually evolve towards softer mildness and suedish muskiness becoming warmer and warmer in a bed of erotic ambergris. The final product of this potent accord is a sort of woodsy, mildly spicy (strong on cloves along the way), aromatic, musky and virile monster compliment getter, extremely sensual (ambergris) and artistic. Muskiness is kind of confident and masculine with its leather-accents and a sort of warm and vaguely powdery ambergris-vibe. What doest overall smells like? Like a sort of mild cool/warm incensey rubber under my vulgar nose (like a sort of oudish more articulated, spicy and amberish Tom Ford Ombré Leather). I see just in part the most quoted (all around from reviewers) comparisons: I detect an olfactory connection to MFK Baccarat Rouge 540 in its initial metallic dustiness and rubbery-medicinal spiciness while definitely I don't see much in common with Dior Sauvage Elixir despite the shared aromatic lavender and an ambery bed of roots and spices, since Oud for Greatness develops an its own proper character basically founded on the various nuances of aoud. Finally the oud note unfolds all is complexity (musky, laundry, warmly sensual and exotic) teleporting the wearer (along a long long trip of adamant duration and agressive projection) in to majestic oriental ambiences of luxury and sophistication. 13th February 2024277931AndrewthecologneguyShow all reviewsBitter herbal agarwood, a la Amouage Interlude sitting side-by-side with Baccarat Rouge 540.Interesting combination that smells better than my description.There is some creaminess that binds it all together, not a specific note, but the interaction of nutmeg with everything else lends a slight gourmand quality at times.The many clones (Lattafa Oud for Glory, Afnan Supremacy in Oud, Ministry of Oud Oud Greatest) are so close it is hard to justify the ask from Initio.Parfums de Marly Haltane is another that is in the family. 26th November 2023275754ADVERTISEMENTScentaholicsShow all reviewsStrong.

This is definitely a western oud fragrance and will be more appealing to those who haven’t dabbled too much in Oud, but every time I wear it, I discover new facets of its complex and inspiring personality. It’s sophisticated, elegant, and fits a variety of circumstances, working especially well in cold weather. The opening hits with saffron and patchouli, and projects with power. Every time I put this in I can really smell it for the first hour, but it continues to give great projection for as much as 12 hours, way outperforming Tom Ford’s Oud Wood (another western oud favorite).As it dries down, it maintains a linearity, but I find that the oud really comes through much later in its lifespan. Often I don’t even smell it until the day after, when I get a whiff on a sweater or jacket, and I think, “Ah, THERE’S the oud.”Longevity and performance are just as good as the smell itself. I haven’t tried some of the better clones like Oud for Glory, so it’s hard for me to compare, but I think Initio knocked it out of the park here. Definitely worth a blind buy of a sample if you’re interested in oud, or generally in spice and woody notes. Oud for Greatness has truly become one of my favorite fragrances in my collection, and outside of the fragrance community, is a scent that will set you apart. 16th January 2023268762BuzzlepuffShow all reviewsHave been settling in with this very nice perfume Oud for Greatness by Initio. The general accomplishment of this product is to bring back the memory of a dry oud wood resin vaporized upon a white hot charcoal incense burner. There is a cooling dry suede opening from the start with lavender revealing its pinene qualities supported by nutmeg and saffron giving a soft leather feel to the opening. The cool opening reminds me of MFK Oud Velvet Mood, or Xerjoff GAO; however the warm musk base adds a little warmth to the character here which reminds me of Acqua di Parma Oud or Armani Prive Oud Royal. This is a nice combination of cool and warm qualities. Through the middle Oud wood, agar wood oil and patchouli keep a central theme of cooling sensual incense that stays on the woody resin side while being lifted by the lavender and nutmeg and soft smokey musk at the very base. I like Oud for Greatness as a perfume and it has good performance overall. Like most oud perfumes the artistry of the oud story in Oud for Greatness is not the equal of any good quality pure oud oil that would cost you the same amount as this 90 ml. but for only 3 gr. of intense pure Cambodian, Indonesian, Malaysian and recently Vietnamese harvested oud oil. Both the perfume and pure oud oil have their place and are different but the naming begs a comparison. As far as an oud based perfume goes Oud for Greatness is enjoyable to wear and accomplishes a very competent burning oud resin aroma. Rated: 4/5. 22nd April 2021241987gmstrackShow all reviewsOud for Greatness by Initio Parfums Prives, in my opinion,is very good, albeit slightly over-hyped. This fragrance is a combination of Montale's Aoud Musk with a splash of BR 450 and a splash of a synthetic woody fragrance, such as Wonderwood by CdG. The oud is semi-challenging with a moldy basement/petrol vibe, but everything is very smooth and nicely blended. I'm also getting a synthetic, masculine, woody musk accord, very similar to the one in Aoud Musk. Sometimes it feels like a masculine leather accord, which makes sense given the saffron and oud. I'm really enjoying the touch of dry sweetness that emerges in the dry down. Please note that my categorization of masculine is based on fragrance marketing/conditioning. OFG is BR 540 Extrait's \"masculine\" brother who listens to 90's butt rock, ironically (he says).I'm happy to own a travel size of OFG, but it isn't going on my full bottle list. Nice performance; overpriced. 3.5/5 19th April 2021241888Varanis RidariShow all reviewsInitio Parfums Privés is a sister label to Parfums de Marly, and their fragrances do not follow the same French theme, instead focusing more on mysticism and myth from Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. In practice, this means headier and denser perfumes with less overall mainstream appeal and a higher price tag to impart the exclusivity of it all. Oud for Greatness (2018) is among the better and more-accessible scents from the collection, seeking to present agarwood in a manner that is cleaner, more approachable, but no less powerful than traditional oud perfumes. I'd say it succeeds at doing this, but draws comparisons to a few other popular luxury niche perfumes in the same market segment as Oud for Greatness. For starters, the bottle very much looks like it's going for that Illuminati/Freemasons secret society vibe, eschewing the usual iconography from the house, and the scent within seems to approach the subject of oud with a Westernized buttoned frock or sportcoat attitude.The opening of Oud for Greatness is a sharp, medicinal oud note that may or may not be synthetic, then polished and rounded by lavender instead of the usual rose, lending this oud interpretation an odd barbershop-like conservatism. Saffron enters the fray next, and comparisons to Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540 (2014) happen at this point, although Oud for Greatness is a great deal more defined than the amorphous blob that is BR 540. Nutmeg adds some dustiness to the mix and eventually cashmeran joins the heart of Oud for Greatness, before akigalawood (fractionated patchouli) and musks enter the final stages to thicken and bolster the woody rounded character of the opening. Oud for Greatness is only semi-sweet with hints of vanilla in the latest stages, and comes across very stately on skin, perfect for formal events, cold weather, and night time. Longevity is good at 10 hours and sillage is about average, but since this is an eau de parfum, I didn't expect obnoxious projection or scent trails. Bottom line is this should last longer than your secret society meetings concerning world domination.My conclusion on this is that Oud for Greatness is a weird hybrid that touches upon barbershop tones, traditional oriental spice, medicinal oud preferred by Western buyers, and a bit of that luxury niche shine to make something that explores many facets of what is popular among male buyers of niche perfumes without smelling directly like a copy of something or like you need a secret handshake to score a bottle. Yeah, you could say this is the oud version of BR 540, but you could also call Parfums de Marly Kalan (2019) the pepper version of BR 540 too, so this kind of reductionism doesn't really serve anyone well, Illuminati or otherwise. If you like BR 540 but find it lacking, Oud for Greatness might be a good alternative, and likewise if you want a high-quality wearable oud without the \"barnyard\" factor, Oud for Greatness may also be a nice option. Whether or not Oud for Greatness, or any Initio perfume is worth the $350+ being asked,is another question altogether, but I suppose catching a deal could make or break the \"greatness\" of this novel take on the subject, Skulls membership not included. Thumbs up. 28th February 2020226378Man Of The WorldShow all reviewsOud For Greatness is a dark fruity oud. I get dried fruit, I get smoke, I get saffron, I get vanilla and I get oud although It's not in your face. OFG is a nice fragrance. It might even be a very nice fragrance. The longevity is pretty decent although the projection is quite low key. Here's my problem. At this price I really need to be blown away. I wasn't. There is not a massive gap between this and some of the cheaper Roja Doves. The difference is that the Rojas blew me away. If this was £90 - £120 I would most probably of bought a bottle. Instead I opted for a large decant. In summary Oud For Greatness offers some greatness but not quite enough for me. 23rd January 2020239463speedracerShow all reviewsThe opening has a bit more of a sharp, biting-oud than the drydown but for the most part, it remains a pretty linear, soft, accessible, dry oud with airy-sweetness on my skin. It does lose some of the oud effect as it gets deep into the drydown but I think the whole fragrance is fading away by that point. What's interesting is the sweetness, reminds me of BR 540. So if you'd like a bit of dry, soft oud in your super sweet crowd-pleaser, this could be a gem find. It comes off more masculine than BR 540 as well, so that could also be a great combination for someone turned off by the sweet and airy MFK fragrance. Sexy stuff.The performance is very good with solid projection and all-day longevity with minimal sprays. 16th January 2020225008BuysblindShow all reviewsOpens with an immediate wallop of rubbery, medicinal oud followed by the gradual emergence of a semi-sweet, fragrant, fruity-floral saffron. 10 or 15 minutes later wafts of a sweet, resinous roasted-sugar accord a la BR540 show up, at which point Oud For Greatness has hit its stride, settling in comfortably with a beautifully warm aroma, the saffron, oud, and roasted sugar all working together harmoniously to create a sillage that is instantly alluring, curious, and appealing. The heart of Oud For Greatness is beautiful. Along with the aforementioned notes there's hints of exotic spice via the nutmeg, a masculine woods provided by the oud, and even some patchouli, lending a dark earthiness to the whole. Sensuality comes via a pleasantly warm musk enveloping the base, aligning the fragrance with the skin. Consequently OFG is sweet, aromatic, woody, and warm, with dark, masculine edges, and a hearty, substantial core. It persists in such a way for several hours. In its final stages, Oud For Greatness is dominated by a heavy sweetness. The resinous sugary accord alluded to earlier comes out in full force and takes over as the other various elements recede more into the background. Whether or not you enjoy this final stage will depend on your appreciation for this sweetness. While I find it pleasant, I prefer the more balanced heart, as the sweetness is somewhat relentless (when still and up close) and one-dimensional. Nevertheless, it's very nice, and some people will probably find this their favorite part. Furthermore, unless your nose is pressed to your body, you are more likely to catch this very sweet stage in wafts, as opposed to a constant direct smell, making it less relentless and less potentially tiring. I don't want this last criticism to overshadow the rest of this review–OFG is a very enjoyable fragrance overall and deserves much of the praise it's received. Performance is stellar, with nearly nuclear projection and 8 plus hours of longevity. While I wouldn't wear this one in the heat, it's fine for the fall, winter and early spring, and seems like it would work very well dressed up or even down. Final rating: 9/10Side note: I currently own this and BR540 and do not find them redundant. However, until recently I also owned Kalan. All three together felt a bit redundant however, due to the resinous burnt sugar accord that ties them together. So in the end I picked my two favorites of the trio and sold off Kalan. 31st December 2019224489landshark321Show all reviewsSecond wearing of Initio Oud for Greatness some ten months after initially trying it out, following its late 2018 release, and it's still quite the interesting spicy oud fragrance that has once again become seasonally appropriate with the weather cooling down.Its blend is full of provocative notes–oud, patchouli, saffron, lavender, patchouli, musks–and it's a strong arrangement, with some lavender to add freshness, nutmeg to add spicy, and saffron as a wildcard to complement what is dominantly an oud/patchouli blend, slightly reminiscent of Parfums de Marly Nisean in its general sense but even more vaguely like a Montale or Mancera aoud/oud-named fragrance, albeit slightly more complex.Oud for Greatness feels rather floral on my skin, too, as I imagine there being rose or something similar in addition to the lavender. It's not particularly sweet but more a spicy woody oud, though not an especially animalic oud, but a safe or smooth oud, as I'd usually classify it.It's solid winter staple, in short. This is something I could wear regularly and not get tired of it, even if I'm not particularly amazed by it. As a side note, its bottle is beautiful, the eye reminding me of masonic imagery from National Treasure, clearly a visual upgrade from the other more sober Initio bottles in the same shape.It's for sale at great retailers like Perfumology, Osswald (from whom I obtained the sample), and Beverly Hills Perfumery, but doesn't come cheap, at only the 90ml size for $350 though there are sometime sales to be had. I really like it, overall, but I don't think I need a bottle, maybe just a large decant. Rehab remains my favorite of the Initio line, though Blessed Baraka is another one that I've wanted to do a full sampling of.7 out of 1015th November 2019223240sjg3839Show all reviewsPerefect name for a damn near perfect oud fragrance IMO.

On my skin it's the opening, initial, middle and landing notes, all as listed.OFG opens with a brief but definite spice blast, which I suppose is saffron & nutmeg. And yes, there is lavender in the opening...lots and lots of lavender, which I have grown to detest in fragrances. Within minutes, a definite oud, or very sour woody note appears and seems to briefly overtake the opening notes. And I very briefly detect ultra-faint patchouli, which almost immediately disperses. But for quite sometime, I detect sour oud, wet wood and lavender.Within 20-30 minutes on my skin, leather and rubber notes emerge that remind me of so many other similar fragrances I simply do not enjoy. Leather, rubber, oily resins. Some mention ambroxan, others mention ambergris...for me it's just a no.An exceptionally masculine fragrance, I cannot imagine why a woman would want to walk around smelling like this. OFG is a powerful fragrance with forever staying power and extreme silage.I may give MFK Baccarat Rouge 540 a try, as others have compared that fragrance to a kinder, gentler, more feminine Initio OFG.One last thought...at OFG's asking price, I would strongly recommend a sample try. IMHO, this is definitely not a blind buy. 18th December 2022268857RedMintShow all reviewsI really didn't love this at first. The lavender and saffron opening is strong and medicinal and came off on my skin as straight-up perfumer's alcohol. As it dried down, it kept that medicine, even while fresh woods began to emerge, which made it really hard for me to enjoy. But throughout the course of the day, it settles into a really nice, non-animalic agarwood/fresh wood combination that ultimately becomes a very pleasant, very masculine woody/spicy skin scent. I kept giving it a shot, and over the course of a month, I came to really appreciate it, even like it, maybe verging on love. Perhaps that is the power of oud, as this was my first experience with that note (although some will say this lacks actual oud and is more about the saffron and lavender). It is overpriced but what you're paying for is the longevity and sillage. If you love this smell, it might be worth the big bucks, especially if you're made of big bucks. But copy houses have replicated this scent at a fraction of the cost (Oud for Glory is a good one), and I cannot in good conscience suggest someone pay over $300 USD for something that can essentially be had for 1/10th of the cost. This is the first time I have ever thought it truly advisable to go with a clone, but that's where I've landed. 20th February 2022254404ADVERTISEMENTgimmegreenShow all reviewsOud for Greatness is often dismissed as a Baccarat Rouge smellalike. As the latter seems to have been created with the express intention of taking out any stray elephants one may encounter during one’s urban peregrinations, the prospects aren’t bright. However, despite sharing the stuck-to-the-pan sugary density of BR and some of its suffocating power, there are points of difference. Oud for Greatness is lighter up top with some foamy lavender and zingy fake saffron, and deeper at the bottom end with peppery charred woods providing much needed contrast to the cotton candy main theme. Thus, its wearability is enhanced somewhat, despite its essentially synthetic scent profile – but nowhere near enough for me to even want to consider its ‘robbed blind’ asking price. 17th December 2021251020clamnoleShow all reviewsFinally got to sample O4G and while it has it's qualities, it comes across a bit underwhelming IMO. The opening is a large dose of lavender, saffron and dry oud. The effect for me is a dry, rotting log. The lavender gives a barbershop undertone that is unusual but not entirely warming or pleasant. The musk and patchouli arrive late to flatten it out, but for me it's overly dry and medicinal. Not my cup of tea for Initio prices. Neutral. 29th November 2021250169Ed WardianShow all reviewsInitio Parfums Privés' takes a highly stylized and tempered approach to the traditional agarwood niche here. This is designed to sway the flock and to appease. From the aesthetic pop of the third-eye trance, to the masonic bottle and its accord, the modus operandi is one of pretty persuasion and possibly the wool being pulled over a frag-head; unfortunately at a luxury premium. Labeled as greatness', the theme feels a bit hollow due to the oud being reduced to an ornamental note, whereby the greatness' is attained with a surprisingly bright lavender and spicy suede of saffron rubbing their spirited zests with zeal and emitting burnt sugary vapours that eventually bring the great' when entering the hearty mouth of this particularly toothless yet fragrant one-eyed agarwood beast. The result is a gracious release of a sensual, savoury barbershop air that is saccharine and chocolaty; only to be further augmented by a sweet musk, and then lessened by a patchouli vinaigrette. The result is a mango-esque toothache of a finish, not far from a certain creed'. Overall, Oud for Greatness' is mass appealing, refined, measured (longevity/projection to the heavens) and merely in line with Western tastes for boring luxury sweeteners. Certainly, this fragrance will sit well with a select hip or those willing to ape or pay a heft for something that plays so safe. Despite the perceived quality, it comes across as pretty vacant, devoid of any soul and simply one for the chorus line... What to do, when birds of a feather flock together. 30th November 2020236539Public EnemaShow all reviewsI like it but it doesn't last that long on my skin and could stand to be a bit stronger. As it stands it should be renamed Oud for mediocracy (the philosopher who never amounted to much). It does remind me a little of Rose D\" Arabie with a less rose and more Oud. 16th November 2020235998Just FragrancesShow all reviewsBR 540 Pour HommeI feel like this fragrance is BR 540 meets Creed Viking. Opens in medicinal synth clean oud like in MFK. Saffron gives it some fruity/floral zing, and nutmeg gives it a kind of new age barbershop kind of smell. This is what makes it like Viking. The overall vibe is spicy BR 540 that can more easily be worn by a man. Way strong, too much. Super synthetic. Composition and blending, average. Feels a little Tom Ford Private Blend basic. Meh, neutral. 28th September 2020234285MarkactorShow all reviewsAfter all of the initial hype, I was excited to get my nose on this. Meh. On my skin it did not last and had a less-than-memorable impression. The oud was there for sure, but even after the 3rd wearing of it, I can't get behind this one. Good, yes. For me, it's a No for Greatness. 31st December 2019224526Most reviews in the last weekmanlyscents (8)Colbourne (8)Varanis Ridari (4)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)landshark321 (3)exmin (3)speedracer (3)RoamingRose (3)SPACEDOUT (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (28)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)Callista25 (9)landshark321 (9)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (8)Lian (7)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

To be honest not so much about Initio Parfums really catches my interest (none of their western-arabic bombastic aesthetic, the pompous Black Gold Project's \"inlaid\" bottles-style and the emphatic fragrances-\"denomination\"). Oud for Greatness is the Initio's prodigal son, one of the few really by me appreciated from the house and actually one of the most succesful western interpretations of the infamous oriental note of aoud (bold muskiness, aromatics, captivating mild spiciness, exotic far lands-aura, fairy tales-conjuration and authoritarian sensualism). Yes, Oud for Greatness is powerful on saffron, mild spices, patchouli, woods and ambergris but it is mostly something about it, His majesty King Oudh. The latter expresses in here many of the variegate nuances this infamous \"ingredient\" could magically unfold in a more western civilized spicy acception, being it in here at same time initially aromatic (freshly metallic spicy aromatic lavender), intoxocating (mild spices), boldly rubbery/medicinal (room cleaner/boots polish/dental detergent-like), woodsy and finally musky spicy with a musky-leathery final touch of ambergris and a subtle molecular brightness with all its dramatic theatricality and its power of sensual hypnosis (with its kind of \"wide\" laundry powdery and soapy exotic muskiness like the golden smell and the aromatic atmosphere of an orietal dreamy arabian hotel as in a fairy tale holiday from One Thousand and One Nights). This fragrance is initially a saffronic-rubbery-kind of incensey (dusty spices) \"neutral\" blast under my profane nose (it seems for a while to experience a sort of milder Durbano Black Tourmaline, since the spicy sweetness is on this phase effectively minimal). Saffron (surrounded by citric, rosey, metallic, herbal accents) is layed down a \"rich in sensualism\" bed of spicy musky western sweet molecular oud and balmy-leathery muskiness. Oud for greatness is in effects mainly a molecular sparkling accord of oud (turbulent and bursting but finally almost talky aromatic), aromatic lavender, mild intoxicating piquant \"metallic\" spices (as inebriating saffron, captivating nutmeg and cloves) and a bold patchouli. This is an hard to be faced accord really vibrant, dark, \"butch\", wide, encompassing and temperamental. Over the first intoxicating spray you are invested by a tornado of aromatic, molecular, kind of aldehydic and metallic spices joined by a sort of citric, medicinal, definitely rubbery and woody oudish surrection. Piquant dusty freshly-metallic spices gradually evolve towards softer mildness and suedish muskiness becoming warmer and warmer in a bed of erotic ambergris. The final product of this potent accord is a sort of woodsy, mildly spicy (strong on cloves along the way), aromatic, musky and virile monster compliment getter, extremely sensual (ambergris) and artistic. Muskiness is kind of confident and masculine with its leather-accents and a sort of warm and vaguely powdery ambergris-vibe. What doest overall smells like? Like a sort of mild cool/warm incensey rubber under my vulgar nose (like a sort of oudish more articulated, spicy and amberish Tom Ford Ombré Leather). I see just in part the most quoted (all around from reviewers) comparisons: I detect an olfactory connection to MFK Baccarat Rouge 540 in its initial metallic dustiness and rubbery-medicinal spiciness while definitely I don't see much in common with Dior Sauvage Elixir despite the shared aromatic lavender and an ambery bed of roots and spices, since Oud for Greatness develops an its own proper character basically founded on the various nuances of aoud. Finally the oud note unfolds all is complexity (musky, laundry, warmly sensual and exotic) teleporting the wearer (along a long long trip of adamant duration and agressive projection) in to majestic oriental ambiences of luxury and sophistication. 13th February 2024277931AndrewthecologneguyShow all reviewsBitter herbal agarwood, a la Amouage Interlude sitting side-by-side with Baccarat Rouge 540.Interesting combination that smells better than my description.There is some creaminess that binds it all together, not a specific note, but the interaction of nutmeg with everything else lends a slight gourmand quality at times.The many clones (Lattafa Oud for Glory, Afnan Supremacy in Oud, Ministry of Oud Oud Greatest) are so close it is hard to justify the ask from Initio.Parfums de Marly Haltane is another that is in the family. 26th November 2023275754ADVERTISEMENTScentaholicsShow all reviewsStrong.

This is definitely a western oud fragrance and will be more appealing to those who haven’t dabbled too much in Oud, but every time I wear it, I discover new facets of its complex and inspiring personality. It’s sophisticated, elegant, and fits a variety of circumstances, working especially well in cold weather. The opening hits with saffron and patchouli, and projects with power. Every time I put this in I can really smell it for the first hour, but it continues to give great projection for as much as 12 hours, way outperforming Tom Ford’s Oud Wood (another western oud favorite).As it dries down, it maintains a linearity, but I find that the oud really comes through much later in its lifespan. Often I don’t even smell it until the day after, when I get a whiff on a sweater or jacket, and I think, “Ah, THERE’S the oud.”Longevity and performance are just as good as the smell itself. I haven’t tried some of the better clones like Oud for Glory, so it’s hard for me to compare, but I think Initio knocked it out of the park here. Definitely worth a blind buy of a sample if you’re interested in oud, or generally in spice and woody notes. Oud for Greatness has truly become one of my favorite fragrances in my collection, and outside of the fragrance community, is a scent that will set you apart. 16th January 2023268762BuzzlepuffShow all reviewsHave been settling in with this very nice perfume Oud for Greatness by Initio. The general accomplishment of this product is to bring back the memory of a dry oud wood resin vaporized upon a white hot charcoal incense burner. There is a cooling dry suede opening from the start with lavender revealing its pinene qualities supported by nutmeg and saffron giving a soft leather feel to the opening. The cool opening reminds me of MFK Oud Velvet Mood, or Xerjoff GAO; however the warm musk base adds a little warmth to the character here which reminds me of Acqua di Parma Oud or Armani Prive Oud Royal. This is a nice combination of cool and warm qualities. Through the middle Oud wood, agar wood oil and patchouli keep a central theme of cooling sensual incense that stays on the woody resin side while being lifted by the lavender and nutmeg and soft smokey musk at the very base. I like Oud for Greatness as a perfume and it has good performance overall. Like most oud perfumes the artistry of the oud story in Oud for Greatness is not the equal of any good quality pure oud oil that would cost you the same amount as this 90 ml. but for only 3 gr. of intense pure Cambodian, Indonesian, Malaysian and recently Vietnamese harvested oud oil. Both the perfume and pure oud oil have their place and are different but the naming begs a comparison. As far as an oud based perfume goes Oud for Greatness is enjoyable to wear and accomplishes a very competent burning oud resin aroma. Rated: 4/5. 22nd April 2021241987gmstrackShow all reviewsOud for Greatness by Initio Parfums Prives, in my opinion,is very good, albeit slightly over-hyped. This fragrance is a combination of Montale's Aoud Musk with a splash of BR 450 and a splash of a synthetic woody fragrance, such as Wonderwood by CdG. The oud is semi-challenging with a moldy basement/petrol vibe, but everything is very smooth and nicely blended. I'm also getting a synthetic, masculine, woody musk accord, very similar to the one in Aoud Musk. Sometimes it feels like a masculine leather accord, which makes sense given the saffron and oud. I'm really enjoying the touch of dry sweetness that emerges in the dry down. Please note that my categorization of masculine is based on fragrance marketing/conditioning. OFG is BR 540 Extrait's \"masculine\" brother who listens to 90's butt rock, ironically (he says).I'm happy to own a travel size of OFG, but it isn't going on my full bottle list. Nice performance; overpriced. 3.5/5 19th April 2021241888Varanis RidariShow all reviewsInitio Parfums Privés is a sister label to Parfums de Marly, and their fragrances do not follow the same French theme, instead focusing more on mysticism and myth from Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. In practice, this means headier and denser perfumes with less overall mainstream appeal and a higher price tag to impart the exclusivity of it all. Oud for Greatness (2018) is among the better and more-accessible scents from the collection, seeking to present agarwood in a manner that is cleaner, more approachable, but no less powerful than traditional oud perfumes. I'd say it succeeds at doing this, but draws comparisons to a few other popular luxury niche perfumes in the same market segment as Oud for Greatness. For starters, the bottle very much looks like it's going for that Illuminati/Freemasons secret society vibe, eschewing the usual iconography from the house, and the scent within seems to approach the subject of oud with a Westernized buttoned frock or sportcoat attitude.The opening of Oud for Greatness is a sharp, medicinal oud note that may or may not be synthetic, then polished and rounded by lavender instead of the usual rose, lending this oud interpretation an odd barbershop-like conservatism. Saffron enters the fray next, and comparisons to Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540 (2014) happen at this point, although Oud for Greatness is a great deal more defined than the amorphous blob that is BR 540. Nutmeg adds some dustiness to the mix and eventually cashmeran joins the heart of Oud for Greatness, before akigalawood (fractionated patchouli) and musks enter the final stages to thicken and bolster the woody rounded character of the opening. Oud for Greatness is only semi-sweet with hints of vanilla in the latest stages, and comes across very stately on skin, perfect for formal events, cold weather, and night time. Longevity is good at 10 hours and sillage is about average, but since this is an eau de parfum, I didn't expect obnoxious projection or scent trails. Bottom line is this should last longer than your secret society meetings concerning world domination.My conclusion on this is that Oud for Greatness is a weird hybrid that touches upon barbershop tones, traditional oriental spice, medicinal oud preferred by Western buyers, and a bit of that luxury niche shine to make something that explores many facets of what is popular among male buyers of niche perfumes without smelling directly like a copy of something or like you need a secret handshake to score a bottle. Yeah, you could say this is the oud version of BR 540, but you could also call Parfums de Marly Kalan (2019) the pepper version of BR 540 too, so this kind of reductionism doesn't really serve anyone well, Illuminati or otherwise. If you like BR 540 but find it lacking, Oud for Greatness might be a good alternative, and likewise if you want a high-quality wearable oud without the \"barnyard\" factor, Oud for Greatness may also be a nice option. Whether or not Oud for Greatness, or any Initio perfume is worth the $350+ being asked,is another question altogether, but I suppose catching a deal could make or break the \"greatness\" of this novel take on the subject, Skulls membership not included. Thumbs up. 28th February 2020226378Man Of The WorldShow all reviewsOud For Greatness is a dark fruity oud. I get dried fruit, I get smoke, I get saffron, I get vanilla and I get oud although It's not in your face. OFG is a nice fragrance. It might even be a very nice fragrance. The longevity is pretty decent although the projection is quite low key. Here's my problem. At this price I really need to be blown away. I wasn't. There is not a massive gap between this and some of the cheaper Roja Doves. The difference is that the Rojas blew me away. If this was £90 - £120 I would most probably of bought a bottle. Instead I opted for a large decant. In summary Oud For Greatness offers some greatness but not quite enough for me. 23rd January 2020239463speedracerShow all reviewsThe opening has a bit more of a sharp, biting-oud than the drydown but for the most part, it remains a pretty linear, soft, accessible, dry oud with airy-sweetness on my skin. It does lose some of the oud effect as it gets deep into the drydown but I think the whole fragrance is fading away by that point. What's interesting is the sweetness, reminds me of BR 540. So if you'd like a bit of dry, soft oud in your super sweet crowd-pleaser, this could be a gem find. It comes off more masculine than BR 540 as well, so that could also be a great combination for someone turned off by the sweet and airy MFK fragrance. Sexy stuff.The performance is very good with solid projection and all-day longevity with minimal sprays. 16th January 2020225008BuysblindShow all reviewsOpens with an immediate wallop of rubbery, medicinal oud followed by the gradual emergence of a semi-sweet, fragrant, fruity-floral saffron. 10 or 15 minutes later wafts of a sweet, resinous roasted-sugar accord a la BR540 show up, at which point Oud For Greatness has hit its stride, settling in comfortably with a beautifully warm aroma, the saffron, oud, and roasted sugar all working together harmoniously to create a sillage that is instantly alluring, curious, and appealing. The heart of Oud For Greatness is beautiful. Along with the aforementioned notes there's hints of exotic spice via the nutmeg, a masculine woods provided by the oud, and even some patchouli, lending a dark earthiness to the whole. Sensuality comes via a pleasantly warm musk enveloping the base, aligning the fragrance with the skin. Consequently OFG is sweet, aromatic, woody, and warm, with dark, masculine edges, and a hearty, substantial core. It persists in such a way for several hours. In its final stages, Oud For Greatness is dominated by a heavy sweetness. The resinous sugary accord alluded to earlier comes out in full force and takes over as the other various elements recede more into the background. Whether or not you enjoy this final stage will depend on your appreciation for this sweetness. While I find it pleasant, I prefer the more balanced heart, as the sweetness is somewhat relentless (when still and up close) and one-dimensional. Nevertheless, it's very nice, and some people will probably find this their favorite part. Furthermore, unless your nose is pressed to your body, you are more likely to catch this very sweet stage in wafts, as opposed to a constant direct smell, making it less relentless and less potentially tiring. I don't want this last criticism to overshadow the rest of this review–OFG is a very enjoyable fragrance overall and deserves much of the praise it's received. Performance is stellar, with nearly nuclear projection and 8 plus hours of longevity. While I wouldn't wear this one in the heat, it's fine for the fall, winter and early spring, and seems like it would work very well dressed up or even down. Final rating: 9/10Side note: I currently own this and BR540 and do not find them redundant. However, until recently I also owned Kalan. All three together felt a bit redundant however, due to the resinous burnt sugar accord that ties them together. So in the end I picked my two favorites of the trio and sold off Kalan. 31st December 2019224489landshark321Show all reviewsSecond wearing of Initio Oud for Greatness some ten months after initially trying it out, following its late 2018 release, and it's still quite the interesting spicy oud fragrance that has once again become seasonally appropriate with the weather cooling down.Its blend is full of provocative notes–oud, patchouli, saffron, lavender, patchouli, musks–and it's a strong arrangement, with some lavender to add freshness, nutmeg to add spicy, and saffron as a wildcard to complement what is dominantly an oud/patchouli blend, slightly reminiscent of Parfums de Marly Nisean in its general sense but even more vaguely like a Montale or Mancera aoud/oud-named fragrance, albeit slightly more complex.Oud for Greatness feels rather floral on my skin, too, as I imagine there being rose or something similar in addition to the lavender. It's not particularly sweet but more a spicy woody oud, though not an especially animalic oud, but a safe or smooth oud, as I'd usually classify it.It's solid winter staple, in short. This is something I could wear regularly and not get tired of it, even if I'm not particularly amazed by it. As a side note, its bottle is beautiful, the eye reminding me of masonic imagery from National Treasure, clearly a visual upgrade from the other more sober Initio bottles in the same shape.It's for sale at great retailers like Perfumology, Osswald (from whom I obtained the sample), and Beverly Hills Perfumery, but doesn't come cheap, at only the 90ml size for $350 though there are sometime sales to be had. I really like it, overall, but I don't think I need a bottle, maybe just a large decant. Rehab remains my favorite of the Initio line, though Blessed Baraka is another one that I've wanted to do a full sampling of.7 out of 1015th November 2019223240sjg3839Show all reviewsPerefect name for a damn near perfect oud fragrance IMO.

On my skin it's the opening, initial, middle and landing notes, all as listed.OFG opens with a brief but definite spice blast, which I suppose is saffron & nutmeg. And yes, there is lavender in the opening...lots and lots of lavender, which I have grown to detest in fragrances. Within minutes, a definite oud, or very sour woody note appears and seems to briefly overtake the opening notes. And I very briefly detect ultra-faint patchouli, which almost immediately disperses. But for quite sometime, I detect sour oud, wet wood and lavender.Within 20-30 minutes on my skin, leather and rubber notes emerge that remind me of so many other similar fragrances I simply do not enjoy. Leather, rubber, oily resins. Some mention ambroxan, others mention ambergris...for me it's just a no.An exceptionally masculine fragrance, I cannot imagine why a woman would want to walk around smelling like this. OFG is a powerful fragrance with forever staying power and extreme silage.I may give MFK Baccarat Rouge 540 a try, as others have compared that fragrance to a kinder, gentler, more feminine Initio OFG.One last thought...at OFG's asking price, I would strongly recommend a sample try. IMHO, this is definitely not a blind buy. 18th December 2022268857RedMintShow all reviewsI really didn't love this at first. The lavender and saffron opening is strong and medicinal and came off on my skin as straight-up perfumer's alcohol. As it dried down, it kept that medicine, even while fresh woods began to emerge, which made it really hard for me to enjoy. But throughout the course of the day, it settles into a really nice, non-animalic agarwood/fresh wood combination that ultimately becomes a very pleasant, very masculine woody/spicy skin scent. I kept giving it a shot, and over the course of a month, I came to really appreciate it, even like it, maybe verging on love. Perhaps that is the power of oud, as this was my first experience with that note (although some will say this lacks actual oud and is more about the saffron and lavender). It is overpriced but what you're paying for is the longevity and sillage. If you love this smell, it might be worth the big bucks, especially if you're made of big bucks. But copy houses have replicated this scent at a fraction of the cost (Oud for Glory is a good one), and I cannot in good conscience suggest someone pay over $300 USD for something that can essentially be had for 1/10th of the cost. This is the first time I have ever thought it truly advisable to go with a clone, but that's where I've landed. 20th February 2022254404ADVERTISEMENTgimmegreenShow all reviewsOud for Greatness is often dismissed as a Baccarat Rouge smellalike. As the latter seems to have been created with the express intention of taking out any stray elephants one may encounter during one’s urban peregrinations, the prospects aren’t bright. However, despite sharing the stuck-to-the-pan sugary density of BR and some of its suffocating power, there are points of difference. Oud for Greatness is lighter up top with some foamy lavender and zingy fake saffron, and deeper at the bottom end with peppery charred woods providing much needed contrast to the cotton candy main theme. Thus, its wearability is enhanced somewhat, despite its essentially synthetic scent profile – but nowhere near enough for me to even want to consider its ‘robbed blind’ asking price. 17th December 2021251020clamnoleShow all reviewsFinally got to sample O4G and while it has it's qualities, it comes across a bit underwhelming IMO. The opening is a large dose of lavender, saffron and dry oud. The effect for me is a dry, rotting log. The lavender gives a barbershop undertone that is unusual but not entirely warming or pleasant. The musk and patchouli arrive late to flatten it out, but for me it's overly dry and medicinal. Not my cup of tea for Initio prices. Neutral. 29th November 2021250169Ed WardianShow all reviewsInitio Parfums Privés' takes a highly stylized and tempered approach to the traditional agarwood niche here. This is designed to sway the flock and to appease. From the aesthetic pop of the third-eye trance, to the masonic bottle and its accord, the modus operandi is one of pretty persuasion and possibly the wool being pulled over a frag-head; unfortunately at a luxury premium. Labeled as greatness', the theme feels a bit hollow due to the oud being reduced to an ornamental note, whereby the greatness' is attained with a surprisingly bright lavender and spicy suede of saffron rubbing their spirited zests with zeal and emitting burnt sugary vapours that eventually bring the great' when entering the hearty mouth of this particularly toothless yet fragrant one-eyed agarwood beast. The result is a gracious release of a sensual, savoury barbershop air that is saccharine and chocolaty; only to be further augmented by a sweet musk, and then lessened by a patchouli vinaigrette. The result is a mango-esque toothache of a finish, not far from a certain creed'. Overall, Oud for Greatness' is mass appealing, refined, measured (longevity/projection to the heavens) and merely in line with Western tastes for boring luxury sweeteners. Certainly, this fragrance will sit well with a select hip or those willing to ape or pay a heft for something that plays so safe. Despite the perceived quality, it comes across as pretty vacant, devoid of any soul and simply one for the chorus line... What to do, when birds of a feather flock together. 30th November 2020236539Public EnemaShow all reviewsI like it but it doesn't last that long on my skin and could stand to be a bit stronger. As it stands it should be renamed Oud for mediocracy (the philosopher who never amounted to much). It does remind me a little of Rose D\" Arabie with a less rose and more Oud. 16th November 2020235998Just FragrancesShow all reviewsBR 540 Pour HommeI feel like this fragrance is BR 540 meets Creed Viking. Opens in medicinal synth clean oud like in MFK. Saffron gives it some fruity/floral zing, and nutmeg gives it a kind of new age barbershop kind of smell. This is what makes it like Viking. The overall vibe is spicy BR 540 that can more easily be worn by a man. Way strong, too much. Super synthetic. Composition and blending, average. Feels a little Tom Ford Private Blend basic. Meh, neutral. 28th September 2020234285MarkactorShow all reviewsAfter all of the initial hype, I was excited to get my nose on this. Meh. On my skin it did not last and had a less-than-memorable impression. The oud was there for sure, but even after the 3rd wearing of it, I can't get behind this one. Good, yes. For me, it's a No for Greatness. 31st December 2019224526Most reviews in the last weekmanlyscents (8)Colbourne (8)Varanis Ridari (4)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)landshark321 (3)exmin (3)speedracer (3)RoamingRose (3)SPACEDOUT (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (28)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)Callista25 (9)landshark321 (9)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (8)Lian (7)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

        "All reviews": "Show all reviewsOud for Greatness is one of my first olfactory experiences with Initio Parfums Prives fragrances, an international niche perfume project with many successful creations performed in collaboration with renowned perfumers as Maurice Roucel, Alberto Morillas, Guillaume Flavigny and famous talented others. To be honest not so much about Initio Parfums really catches my interest (none of their western-arabic bombastic aesthetic, the pompous Black Gold Project's \"inlaid\" bottles-style and the emphatic fragrances-\"denomination\"). Oud for Greatness is the Initio's prodigal son, one of the few really by me appreciated from the house and actually one of the most succesful western interpretations of the infamous oriental note of aoud (bold muskiness, aromatics, captivating mild spiciness, exotic far lands-aura, fairy tales-conjuration and authoritarian sensualism). Yes, Oud for Greatness is powerful on saffron, mild spices, patchouli, woods and ambergris but it is mostly something about it, His majesty King Oudh. The latter expresses in here many of the variegate nuances this infamous \"ingredient\" could magically unfold in a more western civilized spicy acception, being it in here at same time initially aromatic (freshly metallic spicy aromatic lavender), intoxocating (mild spices), boldly rubbery/medicinal (room cleaner/boots polish/dental detergent-like), woodsy and finally musky spicy with a musky-leathery final touch of ambergris and a subtle molecular brightness with all its dramatic theatricality and its power of sensual hypnosis (with its kind of \"wide\" laundry powdery and soapy exotic muskiness like the golden smell and the aromatic atmosphere of an orietal dreamy arabian hotel as in a fairy tale holiday from One Thousand and One Nights). This fragrance is initially a saffronic-rubbery-kind of incensey (dusty spices) \"neutral\" blast under my profane nose (it seems for a while to experience a sort of milder Durbano Black Tourmaline, since the spicy sweetness is on this phase effectively minimal). Saffron (surrounded by citric, rosey, metallic, herbal accents) is layed down a \"rich in sensualism\" bed of spicy musky western sweet molecular oud and balmy-leathery muskiness. Oud for greatness is in effects mainly a molecular sparkling accord of oud (turbulent and bursting but finally almost talky aromatic), aromatic lavender, mild intoxicating piquant \"metallic\" spices (as inebriating saffron, captivating nutmeg and cloves) and a bold patchouli. This is an hard to be faced accord really vibrant, dark, \"butch\", wide, encompassing and temperamental. Over the first intoxicating spray you are invested by a tornado of aromatic, molecular, kind of aldehydic and metallic spices joined by a sort of citric, medicinal, definitely rubbery and woody oudish surrection. Piquant dusty freshly-metallic spices gradually evolve towards softer mildness and suedish muskiness becoming warmer and warmer in a bed of erotic ambergris. The final product of this potent accord is a sort of woodsy, mildly spicy (strong on cloves along the way), aromatic, musky and virile monster compliment getter, extremely sensual (ambergris) and artistic. Muskiness is kind of confident and masculine with its leather-accents and a sort of warm and vaguely powdery ambergris-vibe. What doest overall smells like? Like a sort of mild cool/warm incensey rubber under my vulgar nose (like a sort of oudish more articulated, spicy and amberish Tom Ford Ombré Leather). I see just in part the most quoted (all around from reviewers) comparisons: I detect an olfactory connection to MFK Baccarat Rouge 540 in its initial metallic dustiness and rubbery-medicinal spiciness while definitely I don't see much in common with Dior Sauvage Elixir despite the shared aromatic lavender and an ambery bed of roots and spices, since Oud for Greatness develops an its own proper character basically founded on the various nuances of aoud. Finally the oud note unfolds all is complexity (musky, laundry, warmly sensual and exotic) teleporting the wearer (along a long long trip of adamant duration and agressive projection) in to majestic oriental ambiences of luxury and sophistication. 13th February 2024277931AndrewthecologneguyShow all reviewsBitter herbal agarwood, a la Amouage Interlude sitting side-by-side with Baccarat Rouge 540.Interesting combination that smells better than my description.There is some creaminess that binds it all together, not a specific note, but the interaction of nutmeg with everything else lends a slight gourmand quality at times.The many clones (Lattafa Oud for Glory, Afnan Supremacy in Oud, Ministry of Oud Oud Greatest) are so close it is hard to justify the ask from Initio.Parfums de Marly Haltane is another that is in the family. 26th November 2023275754ADVERTISEMENTScentaholicsShow all reviewsStrong.

This is definitely a western oud fragrance and will be more appealing to those who haven’t dabbled too much in Oud, but every time I wear it, I discover new facets of its complex and inspiring personality. It’s sophisticated, elegant, and fits a variety of circumstances, working especially well in cold weather. The opening hits with saffron and patchouli, and projects with power. Every time I put this in I can really smell it for the first hour, but it continues to give great projection for as much as 12 hours, way outperforming Tom Ford’s Oud Wood (another western oud favorite).As it dries down, it maintains a linearity, but I find that the oud really comes through much later in its lifespan. Often I don’t even smell it until the day after, when I get a whiff on a sweater or jacket, and I think, “Ah, THERE’S the oud.”Longevity and performance are just as good as the smell itself. I haven’t tried some of the better clones like Oud for Glory, so it’s hard for me to compare, but I think Initio knocked it out of the park here. Definitely worth a blind buy of a sample if you’re interested in oud, or generally in spice and woody notes. Oud for Greatness has truly become one of my favorite fragrances in my collection, and outside of the fragrance community, is a scent that will set you apart. 16th January 2023268762tonileefioreShow all reviewsI like complex fragrances that surprise when I wear them but I don't like to purchase a fragrance based on listed notes, only to search long & hard for those notes.Oud For Greatness is straight-up \"as stated.\" Not much complexity, no real surprises. On my skin it's the opening, initial, middle and landing notes, all as listed.OFG opens with a brief but definite spice blast, which I suppose is saffron & nutmeg. And yes, there is lavender in the opening...lots and lots of lavender, which I have grown to detest in fragrances. Within minutes, a definite oud, or very sour woody note appears and seems to briefly overtake the opening notes. And I very briefly detect ultra-faint patchouli, which almost immediately disperses. But for quite sometime, I detect sour oud, wet wood and lavender.Within 20-30 minutes on my skin, leather and rubber notes emerge that remind me of so many other similar fragrances I simply do not enjoy. Leather, rubber, oily resins. Some mention ambroxan, others mention ambergris...for me it's just a no.An exceptionally masculine fragrance, I cannot imagine why a woman would want to walk around smelling like this. OFG is a powerful fragrance with forever staying power and extreme silage.I may give MFK Baccarat Rouge 540 a try, as others have compared that fragrance to a kinder, gentler, more feminine Initio OFG.One last thought...at OFG's asking price, I would strongly recommend a sample try. IMHO, this is definitely not a blind buy. 18th December 2022268857Z_LiDsShow all reviewsHyped and overpriced, for no reason whatsoever. Saffron bomb type BR540 but here on a woody, sweet and spicy base. Pleasant and easy to approach but nothing special. Important trail and big duration, maybe this is the reason for so much hype, bah ... the fact is that with the money it costs, you buy real oud perfumes in which the raw material is there and it is natural and feels good without interference from synthetic aromas and musks. For me it tends to be feminine and certainly suitable for cold weather. EDIT after several hours I can confirm, very rejected, boring, cloying and, at least for me, annoying. 13th October 2022265177RedMintShow all reviewsI really didn't love this at first. The lavender and saffron opening is strong and medicinal and came off on my skin as straight-up perfumer's alcohol. As it dried down, it kept that medicine, even while fresh woods began to emerge, which made it really hard for me to enjoy. But throughout the course of the day, it settles into a really nice, non-animalic agarwood/fresh wood combination that ultimately becomes a very pleasant, very masculine woody/spicy skin scent. I kept giving it a shot, and over the course of a month, I came to really appreciate it, even like it, maybe verging on love. Perhaps that is the power of oud, as this was my first experience with that note (although some will say this lacks actual oud and is more about the saffron and lavender). It is overpriced but what you're paying for is the longevity and sillage. If you love this smell, it might be worth the big bucks, especially if you're made of big bucks. But copy houses have replicated this scent at a fraction of the cost (Oud for Glory is a good one), and I cannot in good conscience suggest someone pay over $300 USD for something that can essentially be had for 1/10th of the cost. This is the first time I have ever thought it truly advisable to go with a clone, but that's where I've landed. 20th February 2022254404gimmegreenShow all reviewsOud for Greatness is often dismissed as a Baccarat Rouge smellalike. As the latter seems to have been created with the express intention of taking out any stray elephants one may encounter during one’s urban peregrinations, the prospects aren’t bright. However, despite sharing the stuck-to-the-pan sugary density of BR and some of its suffocating power, there are points of difference. Oud for Greatness is lighter up top with some foamy lavender and zingy fake saffron, and deeper at the bottom end with peppery charred woods providing much needed contrast to the cotton candy main theme. Thus, its wearability is enhanced somewhat, despite its essentially synthetic scent profile – but nowhere near enough for me to even want to consider its ‘robbed blind’ asking price. 17th December 2021251020clamnoleShow all reviewsFinally got to sample O4G and while it has it's qualities, it comes across a bit underwhelming IMO. The opening is a large dose of lavender, saffron and dry oud. The effect for me is a dry, rotting log. The lavender gives a barbershop undertone that is unusual but not entirely warming or pleasant. The musk and patchouli arrive late to flatten it out, but for me it's overly dry and medicinal. Not my cup of tea for Initio prices. Neutral. 29th November 2021250169BuzzlepuffShow all reviewsHave been settling in with this very nice perfume Oud for Greatness by Initio. The general accomplishment of this product is to bring back the memory of a dry oud wood resin vaporized upon a white hot charcoal incense burner. There is a cooling dry suede opening from the start with lavender revealing its pinene qualities supported by nutmeg and saffron giving a soft leather feel to the opening. The cool opening reminds me of MFK Oud Velvet Mood, or Xerjoff GAO; however the warm musk base adds a little warmth to the character here which reminds me of Acqua di Parma Oud or Armani Prive Oud Royal. This is a nice combination of cool and warm qualities. Through the middle Oud wood, agar wood oil and patchouli keep a central theme of cooling sensual incense that stays on the woody resin side while being lifted by the lavender and nutmeg and soft smokey musk at the very base. I like Oud for Greatness as a perfume and it has good performance overall. Like most oud perfumes the artistry of the oud story in Oud for Greatness is not the equal of any good quality pure oud oil that would cost you the same amount as this 90 ml. but for only 3 gr. of intense pure Cambodian, Indonesian, Malaysian and recently Vietnamese harvested oud oil. Both the perfume and pure oud oil have their place and are different but the naming begs a comparison. As far as an oud based perfume goes Oud for Greatness is enjoyable to wear and accomplishes a very competent burning oud resin aroma. Rated: 4/5. 22nd April 2021241987gmstrackShow all reviewsOud for Greatness by Initio Parfums Prives, in my opinion,is very good, albeit slightly over-hyped. This fragrance is a combination of Montale's Aoud Musk with a splash of BR 450 and a splash of a synthetic woody fragrance, such as Wonderwood by CdG. The oud is semi-challenging with a moldy basement/petrol vibe, but everything is very smooth and nicely blended. I'm also getting a synthetic, masculine, woody musk accord, very similar to the one in Aoud Musk. Sometimes it feels like a masculine leather accord, which makes sense given the saffron and oud. I'm really enjoying the touch of dry sweetness that emerges in the dry down. Please note that my categorization of masculine is based on fragrance marketing/conditioning. OFG is BR 540 Extrait's \"masculine\" brother who listens to 90's butt rock, ironically (he says).I'm happy to own a travel size of OFG, but it isn't going on my full bottle list. Nice performance; overpriced. 3.5/5 19th April 2021241888Ed WardianShow all reviewsInitio Parfums Privés' takes a highly stylized and tempered approach to the traditional agarwood niche here. This is designed to sway the flock and to appease. From the aesthetic pop of the third-eye trance, to the masonic bottle and its accord, the modus operandi is one of pretty persuasion and possibly the wool being pulled over a frag-head; unfortunately at a luxury premium. Labeled as greatness', the theme feels a bit hollow due to the oud being reduced to an ornamental note, whereby the greatness' is attained with a surprisingly bright lavender and spicy suede of saffron rubbing their spirited zests with zeal and emitting burnt sugary vapours that eventually bring the great' when entering the hearty mouth of this particularly toothless yet fragrant one-eyed agarwood beast. The result is a gracious release of a sensual, savoury barbershop air that is saccharine and chocolaty; only to be further augmented by a sweet musk, and then lessened by a patchouli vinaigrette. The result is a mango-esque toothache of a finish, not far from a certain creed'. Overall, Oud for Greatness' is mass appealing, refined, measured (longevity/projection to the heavens) and merely in line with Western tastes for boring luxury sweeteners. Certainly, this fragrance will sit well with a select hip or those willing to ape or pay a heft for something that plays so safe. Despite the perceived quality, it comes across as pretty vacant, devoid of any soul and simply one for the chorus line... What to do, when birds of a feather flock together. 30th November 2020236539Public EnemaShow all reviewsI like it but it doesn't last that long on my skin and could stand to be a bit stronger. As it stands it should be renamed Oud for mediocracy (the philosopher who never amounted to much). It does remind me a little of Rose D\" Arabie with a less rose and more Oud. 16th November 2020235998Just FragrancesShow all reviewsBR 540 Pour HommeI feel like this fragrance is BR 540 meets Creed Viking. Opens in medicinal synth clean oud like in MFK. Saffron gives it some fruity/floral zing, and nutmeg gives it a kind of new age barbershop kind of smell. This is what makes it like Viking. The overall vibe is spicy BR 540 that can more easily be worn by a man. Way strong, too much. Super synthetic. Composition and blending, average. Feels a little Tom Ford Private Blend basic. Meh, neutral. 28th September 2020234285Varanis RidariShow all reviewsInitio Parfums Privés is a sister label to Parfums de Marly, and their fragrances do not follow the same French theme, instead focusing more on mysticism and myth from Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. In practice, this means headier and denser perfumes with less overall mainstream appeal and a higher price tag to impart the exclusivity of it all. Oud for Greatness (2018) is among the better and more-accessible scents from the collection, seeking to present agarwood in a manner that is cleaner, more approachable, but no less powerful than traditional oud perfumes. I'd say it succeeds at doing this, but draws comparisons to a few other popular luxury niche perfumes in the same market segment as Oud for Greatness. For starters, the bottle very much looks like it's going for that Illuminati/Freemasons secret society vibe, eschewing the usual iconography from the house, and the scent within seems to approach the subject of oud with a Westernized buttoned frock or sportcoat attitude.The opening of Oud for Greatness is a sharp, medicinal oud note that may or may not be synthetic, then polished and rounded by lavender instead of the usual rose, lending this oud interpretation an odd barbershop-like conservatism. Saffron enters the fray next, and comparisons to Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540 (2014) happen at this point, although Oud for Greatness is a great deal more defined than the amorphous blob that is BR 540. Nutmeg adds some dustiness to the mix and eventually cashmeran joins the heart of Oud for Greatness, before akigalawood (fractionated patchouli) and musks enter the final stages to thicken and bolster the woody rounded character of the opening. Oud for Greatness is only semi-sweet with hints of vanilla in the latest stages, and comes across very stately on skin, perfect for formal events, cold weather, and night time. Longevity is good at 10 hours and sillage is about average, but since this is an eau de parfum, I didn't expect obnoxious projection or scent trails. Bottom line is this should last longer than your secret society meetings concerning world domination.My conclusion on this is that Oud for Greatness is a weird hybrid that touches upon barbershop tones, traditional oriental spice, medicinal oud preferred by Western buyers, and a bit of that luxury niche shine to make something that explores many facets of what is popular among male buyers of niche perfumes without smelling directly like a copy of something or like you need a secret handshake to score a bottle. Yeah, you could say this is the oud version of BR 540, but you could also call Parfums de Marly Kalan (2019) the pepper version of BR 540 too, so this kind of reductionism doesn't really serve anyone well, Illuminati or otherwise. If you like BR 540 but find it lacking, Oud for Greatness might be a good alternative, and likewise if you want a high-quality wearable oud without the \"barnyard\" factor, Oud for Greatness may also be a nice option. Whether or not Oud for Greatness, or any Initio perfume is worth the $350+ being asked,is another question altogether, but I suppose catching a deal could make or break the \"greatness\" of this novel take on the subject, Skulls membership not included. Thumbs up. 28th February 2020226378Man Of The WorldShow all reviewsOud For Greatness is a dark fruity oud. I get dried fruit, I get smoke, I get saffron, I get vanilla and I get oud although It's not in your face. OFG is a nice fragrance. It might even be a very nice fragrance. The longevity is pretty decent although the projection is quite low key. Here's my problem. At this price I really need to be blown away. I wasn't. There is not a massive gap between this and some of the cheaper Roja Doves. The difference is that the Rojas blew me away. If this was £90 - £120 I would most probably of bought a bottle. Instead I opted for a large decant. In summary Oud For Greatness offers some greatness but not quite enough for me. 23rd January 2020239463speedracerShow all reviewsThe opening has a bit more of a sharp, biting-oud than the drydown but for the most part, it remains a pretty linear, soft, accessible, dry oud with airy-sweetness on my skin. It does lose some of the oud effect as it gets deep into the drydown but I think the whole fragrance is fading away by that point. What's interesting is the sweetness, reminds me of BR 540. So if you'd like a bit of dry, soft oud in your super sweet crowd-pleaser, this could be a gem find. It comes off more masculine than BR 540 as well, so that could also be a great combination for someone turned off by the sweet and airy MFK fragrance. Sexy stuff.The performance is very good with solid projection and all-day longevity with minimal sprays. 16th January 2020225008MarkactorShow all reviewsAfter all of the initial hype, I was excited to get my nose on this. Meh. On my skin it did not last and had a less-than-memorable impression. The oud was there for sure, but even after the 3rd wearing of it, I can't get behind this one. Good, yes. For me, it's a No for Greatness. 31st December 2019224526BuysblindShow all reviewsOpens with an immediate wallop of rubbery, medicinal oud followed by the gradual emergence of a semi-sweet, fragrant, fruity-floral saffron. 10 or 15 minutes later wafts of a sweet, resinous roasted-sugar accord a la BR540 show up, at which point Oud For Greatness has hit its stride, settling in comfortably with a beautifully warm aroma, the saffron, oud, and roasted sugar all working together harmoniously to create a sillage that is instantly alluring, curious, and appealing. The heart of Oud For Greatness is beautiful. Along with the aforementioned notes there's hints of exotic spice via the nutmeg, a masculine woods provided by the oud, and even some patchouli, lending a dark earthiness to the whole. Sensuality comes via a pleasantly warm musk enveloping the base, aligning the fragrance with the skin. Consequently OFG is sweet, aromatic, woody, and warm, with dark, masculine edges, and a hearty, substantial core. It persists in such a way for several hours. In its final stages, Oud For Greatness is dominated by a heavy sweetness. The resinous sugary accord alluded to earlier comes out in full force and takes over as the other various elements recede more into the background. Whether or not you enjoy this final stage will depend on your appreciation for this sweetness. While I find it pleasant, I prefer the more balanced heart, as the sweetness is somewhat relentless (when still and up close) and one-dimensional. Nevertheless, it's very nice, and some people will probably find this their favorite part. Furthermore, unless your nose is pressed to your body, you are more likely to catch this very sweet stage in wafts, as opposed to a constant direct smell, making it less relentless and less potentially tiring. I don't want this last criticism to overshadow the rest of this review–OFG is a very enjoyable fragrance overall and deserves much of the praise it's received. Performance is stellar, with nearly nuclear projection and 8 plus hours of longevity. While I wouldn't wear this one in the heat, it's fine for the fall, winter and early spring, and seems like it would work very well dressed up or even down. Final rating: 9/10Side note: I currently own this and BR540 and do not find them redundant. However, until recently I also owned Kalan. All three together felt a bit redundant however, due to the resinous burnt sugar accord that ties them together. So in the end I picked my two favorites of the trio and sold off Kalan. 31st December 2019224489landshark321Show all reviewsSecond wearing of Initio Oud for Greatness some ten months after initially trying it out, following its late 2018 release, and it's still quite the interesting spicy oud fragrance that has once again become seasonally appropriate with the weather cooling down.Its blend is full of provocative notes–oud, patchouli, saffron, lavender, patchouli, musks–and it's a strong arrangement, with some lavender to add freshness, nutmeg to add spicy, and saffron as a wildcard to complement what is dominantly an oud/patchouli blend, slightly reminiscent of Parfums de Marly Nisean in its general sense but even more vaguely like a Montale or Mancera aoud/oud-named fragrance, albeit slightly more complex.Oud for Greatness feels rather floral on my skin, too, as I imagine there being rose or something similar in addition to the lavender. It's not particularly sweet but more a spicy woody oud, though not an especially animalic oud, but a safe or smooth oud, as I'd usually classify it.It's solid winter staple, in short. This is something I could wear regularly and not get tired of it, even if I'm not particularly amazed by it. As a side note, its bottle is beautiful, the eye reminding me of masonic imagery from National Treasure, clearly a visual upgrade from the other more sober Initio bottles in the same shape.It's for sale at great retailers like Perfumology, Osswald (from whom I obtained the sample), and Beverly Hills Perfumery, but doesn't come cheap, at only the 90ml size for $350 though there are sometime sales to be had. I really like it, overall, but I don't think I need a bottle, maybe just a large decant. Rehab remains my favorite of the Initio line, though Blessed Baraka is another one that I've wanted to do a full sampling of.7 out of 1015th November 2019223240sjg3839Show all reviewsPerefect name for a damn near perfect oud fragrance IMO.

My bottle is from the original release pre-2015. This is beautifully blended and fades down to a lovely vanilla patchouli with a hint of peppermint. Astrid's Diadem radiates more than most for the early parts of its wear, but then settles into its cooling skin scent dry-down in an hour or two and lasts for the day.I vaguely remember this being released as part of a Xmas collection, but I think I prefer this in the heat.

My bottle is from the original release pre-2015. This is beautifully blended and fades down to a lovely vanilla patchouli with a hint of peppermint. Astrid's Diadem radiates more than most for the early parts of its wear, but then settles into its cooling skin scent dry-down in an hour or two and lasts for the day.I vaguely remember this being released as part of a Xmas collection, but I think I prefer this in the heat. Arcana Wildcraft has a way with mint, and this is one of her best examples. 22nd June 2024281683Most reviews in the last weekmanlyscents (8)Colbourne (8)Varanis Ridari (4)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)landshark321 (3)exmin (3)speedracer (3)RoamingRose (3)SPACEDOUT (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (28)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (8)Lian (7)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

A typical 80’s confection, the juice - in a Cyndi Lauper shade of auburn - tells you what it’s all about - even before it's left the bottle; Boucheron is for girls who just wanna have fun with their pong. 26th November 2021278784ramin1215Show all reviewsThe Reader (Young Girl Reading) BY Jean-Honoré Fragonard 1770 25th July 2018204546ADVERTISEMENTHouseOfPhlegethonShow all reviewsBeautifully mixed ingredients. Dancing notes of floral, citrus, and it's slightly animalic. A joy to behold. A modern classic. You will be noticed, while wearing this one. It is a cloud of confidence. A storm of strength. It rains sensuality. 16th June 2017187757PerfumePorMoiShow all reviewsAs befitting its provenance, Boucheron's opening is loud and proud, a confident trumpeting of citrus and big flowers, underlain with a dissonant note of something sharp and woody/vegetal. I put that down to the basil–and maybe the geranium?–mucking about in all the \"pretty,\" but I'm only guessing based on the list of notes. I've worn this dozens of times, and I can't pick anything individual out. Except in the dry down, when Boucheron finally seems to have made it through the turbulence of its kitchen-sink composition and hit cruising altitude with its lushly sweet, powdery, orange creamsicle/vanilla/benzoin dry down. It's like what I always hope L'Heure Bleue will end up being before it devolves into wet pencil shavings.Fantastic bottle, too. 2nd March 2017183514Shifty BatShow all reviewsNothing really stands out to me in this creation, except maybe the impression that everything is in its right place; the basil and tuberose perfectly proportioned to accent and be accented by the sandal and civet, which are in turn toned down to watercolor with the use of iris and benzoin. It is sweet but not tacky, hazy but not at all indistinct. It's just a really well-made fruity floriental. It is rare that a fragrance can smell unmistakably like the 80's but not 'dated.' 14th February 2016168186babsbendixShow all reviewsThis review is for the current EDP.I really don't like the opening - strikes me as very harsh and bitter - though I've learned to wear one spray in warmer weather, where it quickly blooms into a soft, deep, billowing, powdery scent that manages to be elegant and approachable at the same time. The green bitterness I initially don't like proves to make the scent balanced and harmonious as it develops.For that reason, Boucheron has taken the place in my perfume wardrobe of two older scents that were favorites of mine before reformulation - Must de Cartier and Estee Lauder Private Collection. The counterpoint of bitter green notes, white floral, and vanilla or amber is just so divine and velvety when it's done well, and it's certainly done well here.I hadn't grown into Boucheron yet when it launched, so can't compare the versions offhand, only know that I feel quite lucky to have it now as I've lost so many of my great ones, even my old vulgar orange blossom/green/vanilla favorite: the original Dior Addict. 8th July 2014143539Way Off ScenterShow all reviewsGenre: Floral OrientalBoucheron launches on a lovely honeyed neroli accord and fills out, via tuberose, tonka bean, and sandalwood, into a rich, mellow floral bouquet that rivals even Joy, Van Cleef & Arpels First, and Givenchy's Le De in depth and balance. The decadence of indole and the lightest touch of civet lend animalic warmth without distracting from the larger-than-life floral heart, while the silky sandalwood provides a dry counterpoint to what might otherwise have been an overly sweet and heady composition.Sillage and projection are both ample, though Boucheron is not of the same megaphone-wielding volume of its near contemporaries, Giorgio and Amarige. Boucheron endures well on the skin, with a smooth, sweet tonka (coumarin), resin, and musk drydown that generates an appealing warmth while avoiding any trace of the stuffiness that large scale white flower-centered floral-orientals sometimes lapse into. A worthy foray in a field made competitive by so many other classic entries.9th June 2014141290Lisa DPShow all reviewsI tried to wear Boucheron - for 2 years - in the early 1990s as a very young woman. Even then, at the height of my naiveté and arrogance, I knew it was just too big for me. Twenty years later, it may still be too big for me. But then as now, I appreciate Boucheron for the giant it is and was. My memory of it is pure elegance. Orange blossom and clotted cream. I do not remember any sharper notes, just a huge powdery blast that although it went through several incarnations of powder and cream, did not stray from that softness. I love Boucheron for the time of my life it represents. It brings a wry smile to my face when I think of the awkward, unsophisticated, younger me trying to fit such a pretentious, accomplished fragrance. 22nd January 2014135036ScentFanShow all reviewsBowled me overA saleswoman wafted some in my direction and I was a goner, images of operas, long gowns and jewelry immediately in my mind. At home I sang its praises and a bottle forthwith showed up. What a distinct, deep floral, not for the timid. Pros: Powerfully femaleCons: none\" 9th October 2013132255bnusrShow all reviewsI might be yet to grow into this, though I'm no spring chook. It is uncompromising in its lack of top note frippery; it's straight and solidly to the point. With notes as deep and broad as these, it's surprising that there is not so much warmth. This is not so much sensual as forceful. If I were chairperson of a corporation, or party leader, this would tko any opposition before they had a chance to speak. Great psychological warfare.What made this perfume radiantly beautiful was for me starting out late one night by car on a rush trip to a film with a really good hot cup of espresso in my hand. The combination with Boucheron brought the Boucheron complexly and richly into my less prosaic, less disciplined world. A homecoming most wholeheartedly welcome.I love it, even if it's too ESTJ for me.30th December 2012121964PrimroseShow all reviewsBoucheron is a must for lovers of modern French perfumery. I has a lush and classical feel in the warmth and the rich florals of orange blossom and tuberose. \"The Guide\" rates this highly yet infers it is a bit obnoxious, describing being near someone wearing Boucheron is like being photographed next to a colossal marble foot as big as a car, but I disagree.I prefer the Boucheron in the EDP. It is indeed powerful, but it is glamourous and attracting notice. This is not for a wallflower. Apply to suit your skin and the weather and you won't knock anyone out. Instead, enjoy this opulent fragrance. 28th October 2012118708KarmaLeeShow all reviewsIt opens with a hint of floral (neroli?) and a touch of green bitter, then falls into a creamy oakmoss, sandalwood, teensy bit of civit loveliness. I just bought a small bottle of the EdP, and may be in love, and will be looking for more of the 1988 vintage juice.It moves through its notes, not in a linear from here to there way, but in a nice circle of effect. The neroli gives way to the green and that carries the flower and herb right into the spice/sweet benzoin bones of the composition.It projects well, and the drydown is lasting but not overpowerful. 20th March 2012107011dark phoenix 123Show all reviewsi had the chance to test both the vintage edp and edt recently. interestingly, i prefer the edt as the edp came across as sweeter, heavier and lacking in some the effervesence that the edt has. i ended up buying the vintage 75ml edt refillable. a classy oriental floral that does not smell like grandma! :) 21st December 2011102311DarvantShow all reviewsIn the same vein of the more severe, expansive (aldehydes) \"old fashioned\" and inflexible First, of the more mellifluous and indolic Amarige and of the slightly more dusty, rooty and animal Cassini, this  masterful and woodsy combination of the starring neroli, tuberose, smoky sandalwood and mossy benzoin discloses the renowned  and sophisticated  smell of the famous concoction. The general balance is sheer, the mildness is restrained by woods, the soapiness ( initially plain) is well combined with the other elements and with the creamy balsams,the sophistication is enhanced by a slightly rooty iris, the final powderiness is not exaggeratedly talky, the sensuality is exuded under appointment of a smart dosage of animal and tasty civet plus musk and amber, the smokiness is barely pushed up in order to set the bath soap kind of smell on the side of oakmoss and benzoin, in order to shadow the initial  white radiance and to tame the sweetness of florals and balsams. The initial blast of citrus is moderated in intensity and enveloped at once by a taming milky dust. The floral sumptuousity is supported by a radiant jasmine combined with the slightly exotic and tasty note of ylang-ylang. The last supposts the tastiness of vanilla and benzoin. The final issue is a boise' whiff of orangy balsams, sandalwood, soap and tuberose. Lemon, geranium, oakmoss, tonka and dry woods balance cleverly the mellifluence of the other elements. The tuberose is not \"criminelle\" but carefree and polite. Another great classic. 27th October 201199671Red TheodoraShow all reviewsBoucheron was and still is a lovely floral/oriental. I think you must a floral lover to truely appreciate this scent. I love that it starts out with a little kick of citrus with the floral accord swooping in right after. It's the oakmossy vanilla dry down, though, that I find so comforting. It's all in all a very well-structured fragrance! 19th August 201195948blood-orangeShow all reviewsThe previous reviews that highly praise this scent are definitely written by people with excellent taste in fragrances. Boucheron is a scent which defines sophistication, elegance and class. A rich, unmissable fragrance that doesn't have the popularity that it deserves.I spent many months searching for this particular fragrance, and only managed to find the EDT concentration in an exclusive fragrance boutique. I was highly impressed by the EDT, and when I read that the EDP is even more impressive, I can't help being dumbfounded by this scent.Boucheron is everything that a fragrance should be; complex, unique, intense and memorable. This fragrance has been created with the upmost care, blended beautifully, resulting in a rich, warm and feminine scent.The top notes are not your typical nose-burning citruses and fruits, they have all been blended perfectly creating a scent that is inviting and interesting. Vanilla makes it's presence known right from the very beginning. It's the combination of the vanilla mixed with the lemon, orange and basil and then with the floral accords in the heart of this scent, that fascinates me in so many ways.In no way is this fragrance dusty and 'old-smelling'. To describe this fragrance as being suited only to mature aged women is very misinformative. Any woman that loves this fragrance should be able to pull this off, it's not restricted to any age group.Everything from the scent to the bottle is clearly elegant and sophisticated, making this scent perfect for those strict formal events and occasions. It's such a shame that this fragrance isn't more readily available in my country, although I have heard that where it is available, it sells extremely well.Classic, Boucheron most certainly is. Expensive, but well worth the money spent. The lasting strength is guaranteed to be a highlight as it lasts well into the next day and clings to your clothes for days, managing to scent your wardrobe with its rich aroma.I highly recommend this fragrance and advise people that have not tried this scent to \"get thee to a tester immediately\", this perfume is not to be missed.3rd June 201192193Weimar27Show all reviewsThey don't make them like these anymore the complex and multilayerd floral was so in vogue in the 80'sback then Perfume was an artistry they had the timeto examine and experiment every note possible in a Fragrance ranging from florals spices raisens and deep animalistic notes now modern perfumeryis a mere shadow of the glorious 80's now choked with watery fruity scent that has no charactor or silage hastely produced for the masses leaving art and more profit to the industry.But Boucheron is much more then that it's a relicto the past we need to make people aware that these gems exists and don't think of them as a granny perfume or it smells old and outdated look beyond those boundries and see what have you been missingbefore it gets discontinued.What surprises me about Boucheron is the notes complex yet well put together like well craftedjewelery or a finely chissled sculpture Boucheronis a work of art, It opens crisp with Bergamot sharpness of Lemon aromantic cassis and closing the openiing is zesty basil, in a few minutes dries fruity with apricots sweet but it does'nt overcloy tangerine with it's tangy nuances makes it's presence known there's a hint of spicy Gerainums noticible and add some spiciness to the perfume.Tuberose opens the heart of the fragrance with a buttery sweetness delicate note of jasmine gives an herbal feel and smell Narcissus dominates the middle notes almost drowning the others into obillvion with it's deep and intoxicating scent Lily of the Vally is the elusive note of all i can't dectect, the drydown to the ending sweetish with amber patches of musk and traces of Civet for animalitic properties Benzoin note makes the perfume a bit milky and resianious; the finishing notes of sandalwood adds the dryness and vanilla with it's powdery sweetness 6th March 201186408odysseusmShow all reviewsHere's an oriental I can whole-heartedly endorse. It is rich, smooth; yet not heavy and not too sweet. Lemon and light herbs mingle into well-blended florals. The tuberose and iris and handled with restraint (they don't dominate). A light mossy base is a lovely cushion for everything. Very chic and attractive. 31st January 201184078BlondeDiva71Show all reviewsThis is one of my favorites from as far back as '89!! It has a very special place in my heart as I wore this scent when I was with someone special and the scent always transports me back to those memories. Enough reminiscing! Upon application I immediately pick up the top notes of Lemon & Orange Blossom (and I love Orange Blossom!). It settles briefly into beautiful mid-notes of Iris & Sandalwood before it's sexy drydown into a Tonka Bean note with just a hint of Civet & Benzoin. This is a quite 'regal' scent...smells quite expensive (and it's NOT cheap!) and has to be worn by a person with the right body chemistry or it can be overwhelming. A lot of people are saying this is an 'over-blown 80's scent'...as if it were like Opium or something. I'd have to disagree. This scent didn't come on the scene until the end of the 80's and it's a very complex, multi-note scent with excellent Sillage. TWO thumbs UP from me for Boucheron!! 3rd December 201079981BayKATShow all reviewsSince you can get the gist from previous reviews that this is a great fragrance, (and because I'm too self-conscious to follow up after Hillaire's fantastic review), i'll just keep my comments short. This is one fragrance that made me say WOW. highly recommend, however, if you are thinking of buying on-line at a discount site beware, this did not work for me and i had to throw my bottle in the trash. Make sure anything you buy is fresh, or you won't get the magic of this wonderful creation. 13th March 201075567misscaseyShow all reviewsNICE!! Unlike other scents of its genre and time, Boucheron is not very musky- just big, warm, and bright. Not too sweet, but sweet enough to make the florals feel at home. I like how its not too cheery and not too serious. Boucheron has found an important place on my \"if I can find cheaply enough\" wish list. 3rd August 200966589djolneyShow all reviewsThis review is for the EdP formulation.Sexy, sophisticated, and elegant.Boucheron opens with a lovely combination of lemon, bergamot, orange flowers, and basil. The basil gives the opening a herbaceous air, which takes the sharp edge off of all of the citrus. Consequently, one gets to experience the full complexity of the bergamot and lemon. The combination of basil and orange flowers is captivating, and I like this expression of orange flowers even more than the petals in Caron Nocturnes.As the heart of the fragrance makes its presence felt, a perfectly balanced combination of iris and geranium weaves its way from the highest note to the lowest note, drawing everything together. The iris is sweet without being cloying, and the geranium lends the fragrance a sexy smoulder. The tuberose smells like an entire garden of flowers, and blends seamlessly with the geranium, iris, and citrus.The base of Boucheron begins with a creamy sandalwood, which could easily become too sweet if not for the oak moss and civet that accompany it. The oak moss gives the sandalwood depth and earthiness, and the civet turns the base sexy.As Boucheron reaches its dry down, vanilla is added to the base. Like in Boucheron Jaipur pour Homme, this is a spicy and complex vanilla, and adds to the sexy base.It could be said that Boucheron is an old fashioned fragrance, and this is fine with me. In this case old fashioned means sexy, sophisticated, and elegant, and all I've got to say is bring on the past.As a guy who frequently wears Boucheron pour Homme and Boucheron Jaipur pour Homme, I'm not sure I could get away with wearing Boucheron, but I'm oh so happy that it is out there for women to wear.For any fans of Chanel No. 19 EdP out there, I think Boucheron is one that you should definitely check out. 21st March 200957249ginaginaShow all reviewsMy favorite scent. Reminds me of entering a fabulous party dressed to kill and dripping in precious stones. Since I can't afford any of the above, I buy the perfume instead. Strong, lingering but captivating and unique. Sexy, spicey, enchanting and mysterious. Demands respect, and has a spoonful of attitude. Love it. 28th January 200966394SirenaShow all reviewsWhen I was a teenager my dad's brother's family would join us every summer for a vacation to Barbados or Margarita Island. Every evening my aunt would wear Boucheron and at the end of the trip she'd give me what was left of the bottle. This fragrance is tropical island nights and teasing marine breezes. It's the warmth of suntanned skin, the flaunting of island flowers and the mystery of the ocean rolling under the stars.Boucheron seems to surround me in beauty and mystery.

So do I. The base is warm, spicy and woody, as she points out - which gives it the overall feel of a fruity oriental.It is quite pleasant, but is for me in no way special or interesting. Thus the neutral review. I wish the base notes had been upped and the perfumer had taken the chance of making this a more floral/animalic oriental, since all the players were there, just not mixed appropriately for my taste.Top notes: Bergamot, Lemon, Cassis, Basil, NeroliHeart notes: Jasmine, Orris, Muguet, Tuberose, Geranium, Cedarwood, SandalwoodBase notes: Ambrein, Tonka, Benzoin, Oakmoss, Olibanum, Civet, Musk 24th July 2014144250nonnativeShow all reviewsBoucheron should be a thumb up for a person like me, in love of strong and vintage parfumes. But it is a neutral. Perhaps is its too oldy drydown, perhaps is it to sweet and doesn't evolve well. There is something that doesn't intrigue me. Boucheron should be a floral but what I perceive is too heavy to remind me of flowers.What I appreciate is its warmth and class. And the beautiful rounded bottle that stands perfectly in my hand. A nice sensation: an object thought and designed having in mind the gestures of a lady spraying in front of the mirror. 29th January 2013123516ADVERTISEMENTwillaFriendShow all reviewsStarted out quite nice. No burn on the initial spray. It settled into a soft powdery scent, which was pretty okay-ish, but then it transmogrified into a harsher version of those Necco wafers in the waxed paper tube. Spicy powdery candy. I guess that's the tonka bean rearing its massive head. Very robust. I tried to wash it off and it wouldn't go. Now I'm scared of it and hide behind a display case whenever I cross its path in a department store. Since I like it and cannot stand it at the same time, I'm giving it a neutral. 24th December 2012121689anomie et ivoireShow all reviewsViscous, plasticine, busier than a Byzantine mosaic and as finely wrought, but the buxom lavishness comes on like a bordello madame. And what is she selling? Boucheron has an amber agenda, a slick citrus schtick, oxymoronic or not vanillic dominatrix, bridesmaid fighting violently over maximalist white and orange bouquet gold digger slash murderess aspirations, and on and on. Thrilling on the right opera diva. For those less given to dancing in fountains in strapless gowns, original formula Rochas Byzance is a dreamlike, more nuanced take on post-opiated excess that I much prefer to Boucheron.21st November 2012120041vintage*redShow all reviewsAnother one of those \"Big Eighties\" (REALLY BIG) scents! It is powerful, long lasting and complex. From the notes in this, I should really like it, but it is ALL perfume and no heart. 2nd August 200858217lanaiShow all reviewsI used to use Boucheron a few years ago and loved it. It was classy, complex with depth and definitely for the eveing. I don't know why I stopped using it. Maybe I'll give another try. I probably just fell out of love with it.

Contrarily, my friend who smokes loves it and it's very nice on her skin. Men ask her what she's wearing, they like it so much. As a side note, this friend also often refers to herself as 'an old lady.' (not quite the case, but I found that amusing after reading the reviews that call this an old lady perfume.) 29th April 200738875rickieShow all reviewsI bought a bottle of this and I did use the whole thing.

Is it me or have they changed the formula????? 4th November 2012119142jtdShow all reviewsUsing exclusively synthetic aromachemicals to make a perfume has benefits and risks. Tweaking abstract chemical components can allow for an interesting use of qualities to make a statement (eg. Lauder's Dazzling Silver or CdG's Synthetic Series.) The trap is in trying to recreate notes otherwise provided by botanicals. Simulation is risky against a known quantity. Boucheron attempts to make a floriental using flower-analogues and amber-analogues. These chemicals come off as both thin (no flesh to grab a hold of) and over-amped (no dimmer and the fluorescence is blinding.) If the goal of using synthetics is to produce a facsimile of known botanicals, missing the mark by a smidge doesn't read as a near miss, it reads as horrifying. Boucheron smells just like mid-1980s make-up looked: un-nuanced two-dimensional drawing on a three-dimensional figure. 19th March 201192412ADVERTISEMENTLisaandthewordShow all reviews1st try opening was great- really nice powdery orange floral Classy, comfy, fancy all at once. soft & feminine, a little sweet. potent sillage.

I put that down to the basil–and maybe the geranium?–mucking about in all the \"pretty,\" but I'm only guessing based on the list of notes. I've worn this dozens of times, and I can't pick anything individual out. Except in the dry down, when Boucheron finally seems to have made it through the turbulence of its kitchen-sink composition and hit cruising altitude with its lushly sweet, powdery, orange creamsicle/vanilla/benzoin dry down.

The decadence of indole and the lightest touch of civet lend animalic warmth without distracting from the larger-than-life floral heart, while the silky sandalwood provides a dry counterpoint to what might otherwise have been an overly sweet and heady composition.Sillage and projection are both ample, though Boucheron is not of the same megaphone-wielding volume of its near contemporaries, Giorgio and Amarige. Boucheron endures well on the skin, with a smooth, sweet tonka (coumarin), resin, and musk drydown that generates an appealing warmth while avoiding any trace of the stuffiness that large scale white flower-centered floral-orientals sometimes lapse into. A worthy foray in a field made competitive by so many other classic entries.9th June 2014141290Lisa DPShow all reviewsI tried to wear Boucheron - for 2 years - in the early 1990s as a very young woman. Even then, at the height of my naiveté and arrogance, I knew it was just too big for me. Twenty years later, it may still be too big for me. But then as now, I appreciate Boucheron for the giant it is and was. My memory of it is pure elegance. Orange blossom and clotted cream. I do not remember any sharper notes, just a huge powdery blast that although it went through several incarnations of powder and cream, did not stray from that softness. I love Boucheron for the time of my life it represents. It brings a wry smile to my face when I think of the awkward, unsophisticated, younger me trying to fit such a pretentious, accomplished fragrance. 22nd January 2014135036ScentFanShow all reviewsBowled me overA saleswoman wafted some in my direction and I was a goner, images of operas, long gowns and jewelry immediately in my mind. At home I sang its praises and a bottle forthwith showed up. What a distinct, deep floral, not for the timid. Pros: Powerfully femaleCons: none\" 9th October 2013132255bnusrShow all reviewsI might be yet to grow into this, though I'm no spring chook. It is uncompromising in its lack of top note frippery; it's straight and solidly to the point. With notes as deep and broad as these, it's surprising that there is not so much warmth. This is not so much sensual as forceful. If I were chairperson of a corporation, or party leader, this would tko any opposition before they had a chance to speak. Great psychological warfare.What made this perfume radiantly beautiful was for me starting out late one night by car on a rush trip to a film with a really good hot cup of espresso in my hand. The combination with Boucheron brought the Boucheron complexly and richly into my less prosaic, less disciplined world. A homecoming most wholeheartedly welcome.I love it, even if it's too ESTJ for me.30th December 2012121964PrimroseShow all reviewsBoucheron is a must for lovers of modern French perfumery. I has a lush and classical feel in the warmth and the rich florals of orange blossom and tuberose. \"The Guide\" rates this highly yet infers it is a bit obnoxious, describing being near someone wearing Boucheron is like being photographed next to a colossal marble foot as big as a car, but I disagree.I prefer the Boucheron in the EDP. It is indeed powerful, but it is glamourous and attracting notice. This is not for a wallflower. Apply to suit your skin and the weather and you won't knock anyone out. Instead, enjoy this opulent fragrance. 28th October 2012118708KarmaLeeShow all reviewsIt opens with a hint of floral (neroli?) and a touch of green bitter, then falls into a creamy oakmoss, sandalwood, teensy bit of civit loveliness. I just bought a small bottle of the EdP, and may be in love, and will be looking for more of the 1988 vintage juice.It moves through its notes, not in a linear from here to there way, but in a nice circle of effect. The neroli gives way to the green and that carries the flower and herb right into the spice/sweet benzoin bones of the composition.It projects well, and the drydown is lasting but not overpowerful. 20th March 2012107011dark phoenix 123Show all reviewsi had the chance to test both the vintage edp and edt recently. interestingly, i prefer the edt as the edp came across as sweeter, heavier and lacking in some the effervesence that the edt has. i ended up buying the vintage 75ml edt refillable. a classy oriental floral that does not smell like grandma! :) 21st December 2011102311DarvantShow all reviewsIn the same vein of the more severe, expansive (aldehydes) \"old fashioned\" and inflexible First, of the more mellifluous and indolic Amarige and of the slightly more dusty, rooty and animal Cassini, this  masterful and woodsy combination of the starring neroli, tuberose, smoky sandalwood and mossy benzoin discloses the renowned  and sophisticated  smell of the famous concoction. The general balance is sheer, the mildness is restrained by woods, the soapiness ( initially plain) is well combined with the other elements and with the creamy balsams,the sophistication is enhanced by a slightly rooty iris, the final powderiness is not exaggeratedly talky, the sensuality is exuded under appointment of a smart dosage of animal and tasty civet plus musk and amber, the smokiness is barely pushed up in order to set the bath soap kind of smell on the side of oakmoss and benzoin, in order to shadow the initial  white radiance and to tame the sweetness of florals and balsams. The initial blast of citrus is moderated in intensity and enveloped at once by a taming milky dust. The floral sumptuousity is supported by a radiant jasmine combined with the slightly exotic and tasty note of ylang-ylang. The last supposts the tastiness of vanilla and benzoin. The final issue is a boise' whiff of orangy balsams, sandalwood, soap and tuberose. Lemon, geranium, oakmoss, tonka and dry woods balance cleverly the mellifluence of the other elements. The tuberose is not \"criminelle\" but carefree and polite. Another great classic. 27th October 201199671Red TheodoraShow all reviewsBoucheron was and still is a lovely floral/oriental. I think you must a floral lover to truely appreciate this scent. I love that it starts out with a little kick of citrus with the floral accord swooping in right after. It's the oakmossy vanilla dry down, though, that I find so comforting. It's all in all a very well-structured fragrance! 19th August 201195948blood-orangeShow all reviewsThe previous reviews that highly praise this scent are definitely written by people with excellent taste in fragrances. Boucheron is a scent which defines sophistication, elegance and class. A rich, unmissable fragrance that doesn't have the popularity that it deserves.I spent many months searching for this particular fragrance, and only managed to find the EDT concentration in an exclusive fragrance boutique. I was highly impressed by the EDT, and when I read that the EDP is even more impressive, I can't help being dumbfounded by this scent.Boucheron is everything that a fragrance should be; complex, unique, intense and memorable. This fragrance has been created with the upmost care, blended beautifully, resulting in a rich, warm and feminine scent.The top notes are not your typical nose-burning citruses and fruits, they have all been blended perfectly creating a scent that is inviting and interesting. Vanilla makes it's presence known right from the very beginning. It's the combination of the vanilla mixed with the lemon, orange and basil and then with the floral accords in the heart of this scent, that fascinates me in so many ways.In no way is this fragrance dusty and 'old-smelling'. To describe this fragrance as being suited only to mature aged women is very misinformative. Any woman that loves this fragrance should be able to pull this off, it's not restricted to any age group.Everything from the scent to the bottle is clearly elegant and sophisticated, making this scent perfect for those strict formal events and occasions. It's such a shame that this fragrance isn't more readily available in my country, although I have heard that where it is available, it sells extremely well.Classic, Boucheron most certainly is. Expensive, but well worth the money spent. The lasting strength is guaranteed to be a highlight as it lasts well into the next day and clings to your clothes for days, managing to scent your wardrobe with its rich aroma.I highly recommend this fragrance and advise people that have not tried this scent to \"get thee to a tester immediately\", this perfume is not to be missed.3rd June 201192193Weimar27Show all reviewsThey don't make them like these anymore the complex and multilayerd floral was so in vogue in the 80'sback then Perfume was an artistry they had the timeto examine and experiment every note possible in a Fragrance ranging from florals spices raisens and deep animalistic notes now modern perfumeryis a mere shadow of the glorious 80's now choked with watery fruity scent that has no charactor or silage hastely produced for the masses leaving art and more profit to the industry.But Boucheron is much more then that it's a relicto the past we need to make people aware that these gems exists and don't think of them as a granny perfume or it smells old and outdated look beyond those boundries and see what have you been missingbefore it gets discontinued.What surprises me about Boucheron is the notes complex yet well put together like well craftedjewelery or a finely chissled sculpture Boucheronis a work of art, It opens crisp with Bergamot sharpness of Lemon aromantic cassis and closing the openiing is zesty basil, in a few minutes dries fruity with apricots sweet but it does'nt overcloy tangerine with it's tangy nuances makes it's presence known there's a hint of spicy Gerainums noticible and add some spiciness to the perfume.Tuberose opens the heart of the fragrance with a buttery sweetness delicate note of jasmine gives an herbal feel and smell Narcissus dominates the middle notes almost drowning the others into obillvion with it's deep and intoxicating scent Lily of the Vally is the elusive note of all i can't dectect, the drydown to the ending sweetish with amber patches of musk and traces of Civet for animalitic properties Benzoin note makes the perfume a bit milky and resianious; the finishing notes of sandalwood adds the dryness and vanilla with it's powdery sweetness 6th March 201186408odysseusmShow all reviewsHere's an oriental I can whole-heartedly endorse. It is rich, smooth; yet not heavy and not too sweet. Lemon and light herbs mingle into well-blended florals. The tuberose and iris and handled with restraint (they don't dominate). A light mossy base is a lovely cushion for everything. Very chic and attractive. 31st January 201184078BlondeDiva71Show all reviewsThis is one of my favorites from as far back as '89!! It has a very special place in my heart as I wore this scent when I was with someone special and the scent always transports me back to those memories. Enough reminiscing! Upon application I immediately pick up the top notes of Lemon & Orange Blossom (and I love Orange Blossom!). It settles briefly into beautiful mid-notes of Iris & Sandalwood before it's sexy drydown into a Tonka Bean note with just a hint of Civet & Benzoin. This is a quite 'regal' scent...smells quite expensive (and it's NOT cheap!) and has to be worn by a person with the right body chemistry or it can be overwhelming. A lot of people are saying this is an 'over-blown 80's scent'...as if it were like Opium or something. I'd have to disagree. This scent didn't come on the scene until the end of the 80's and it's a very complex, multi-note scent with excellent Sillage. TWO thumbs UP from me for Boucheron!! 3rd December 201079981BayKATShow all reviewsSince you can get the gist from previous reviews that this is a great fragrance, (and because I'm too self-conscious to follow up after Hillaire's fantastic review), i'll just keep my comments short. This is one fragrance that made me say WOW. highly recommend, however, if you are thinking of buying on-line at a discount site beware, this did not work for me and i had to throw my bottle in the trash. Make sure anything you buy is fresh, or you won't get the magic of this wonderful creation. 13th March 201075567misscaseyShow all reviewsNICE!! Unlike other scents of its genre and time, Boucheron is not very musky- just big, warm, and bright. Not too sweet, but sweet enough to make the florals feel at home. I like how its not too cheery and not too serious. Boucheron has found an important place on my \"if I can find cheaply enough\" wish list. 3rd August 200966589djolneyShow all reviewsThis review is for the EdP formulation.Sexy, sophisticated, and elegant.Boucheron opens with a lovely combination of lemon, bergamot, orange flowers, and basil. The basil gives the opening a herbaceous air, which takes the sharp edge off of all of the citrus. Consequently, one gets to experience the full complexity of the bergamot and lemon. The combination of basil and orange flowers is captivating, and I like this expression of orange flowers even more than the petals in Caron Nocturnes.As the heart of the fragrance makes its presence felt, a perfectly balanced combination of iris and geranium weaves its way from the highest note to the lowest note, drawing everything together. The iris is sweet without being cloying, and the geranium lends the fragrance a sexy smoulder. The tuberose smells like an entire garden of flowers, and blends seamlessly with the geranium, iris, and citrus.The base of Boucheron begins with a creamy sandalwood, which could easily become too sweet if not for the oak moss and civet that accompany it. The oak moss gives the sandalwood depth and earthiness, and the civet turns the base sexy.As Boucheron reaches its dry down, vanilla is added to the base. Like in Boucheron Jaipur pour Homme, this is a spicy and complex vanilla, and adds to the sexy base.It could be said that Boucheron is an old fashioned fragrance, and this is fine with me. In this case old fashioned means sexy, sophisticated, and elegant, and all I've got to say is bring on the past.As a guy who frequently wears Boucheron pour Homme and Boucheron Jaipur pour Homme, I'm not sure I could get away with wearing Boucheron, but I'm oh so happy that it is out there for women to wear.For any fans of Chanel No. 19 EdP out there, I think Boucheron is one that you should definitely check out. 21st March 200957249ginaginaShow all reviewsMy favorite scent. Reminds me of entering a fabulous party dressed to kill and dripping in precious stones. Since I can't afford any of the above, I buy the perfume instead. Strong, lingering but captivating and unique. Sexy, spicey, enchanting and mysterious. Demands respect, and has a spoonful of attitude. Love it. 28th January 200966394SirenaShow all reviewsWhen I was a teenager my dad's brother's family would join us every summer for a vacation to Barbados or Margarita Island. Every evening my aunt would wear Boucheron and at the end of the trip she'd give me what was left of the bottle. This fragrance is tropical island nights and teasing marine breezes. It's the warmth of suntanned skin, the flaunting of island flowers and the mystery of the ocean rolling under the stars.Boucheron seems to surround me in beauty and mystery.

But it is a neutral. Perhaps is its too oldy drydown, perhaps is it to sweet and doesn't evolve well. There is something that doesn't intrigue me. Boucheron should be a floral but what I perceive is too heavy to remind me of flowers.What I appreciate is its warmth and class. And the beautiful rounded bottle that stands perfectly in my hand. A nice sensation: an object thought and designed having in mind the gestures of a lady spraying in front of the mirror. 29th January 2013123516ADVERTISEMENTwillaFriendShow all reviewsStarted out quite nice. No burn on the initial spray. It settled into a soft powdery scent, which was pretty okay-ish, but then it transmogrified into a harsher version of those Necco wafers in the waxed paper tube. Spicy powdery candy. I guess that's the tonka bean rearing its massive head. Very robust. I tried to wash it off and it wouldn't go. Now I'm scared of it and hide behind a display case whenever I cross its path in a department store. Since I like it and cannot stand it at the same time, I'm giving it a neutral. 24th December 2012121689anomie et ivoireShow all reviewsViscous, plasticine, busier than a Byzantine mosaic and as finely wrought, but the buxom lavishness comes on like a bordello madame. And what is she selling? Boucheron has an amber agenda, a slick citrus schtick, oxymoronic or not vanillic dominatrix, bridesmaid fighting violently over maximalist white and orange bouquet gold digger slash murderess aspirations, and on and on. Thrilling on the right opera diva. For those less given to dancing in fountains in strapless gowns, original formula Rochas Byzance is a dreamlike, more nuanced take on post-opiated excess that I much prefer to Boucheron.21st November 2012120041vintage*redShow all reviewsAnother one of those \"Big Eighties\" (REALLY BIG) scents! It is powerful, long lasting and complex. From the notes in this, I should really like it, but it is ALL perfume and no heart. 2nd August 200858217lanaiShow all reviewsI used to use Boucheron a few years ago and loved it. It was classy, complex with depth and definitely for the eveing. I don't know why I stopped using it. Maybe I'll give another try. I probably just fell out of love with it.

Contrarily, my friend who smokes loves it and it's very nice on her skin. Men ask her what she's wearing, they like it so much. As a side note, this friend also often refers to herself as 'an old lady.'

Is it me or have they changed the formula????? 4th November 2012119142jtdShow all reviewsUsing exclusively synthetic aromachemicals to make a perfume has benefits and risks. Tweaking abstract chemical components can allow for an interesting use of qualities to make a statement (eg. Lauder's Dazzling Silver or CdG's Synthetic Series.) The trap is in trying to recreate notes otherwise provided by botanicals. Simulation is risky against a known quantity. Boucheron attempts to make a floriental using flower-analogues and amber-analogues. These chemicals come off as both thin (no flesh to grab a hold of) and over-amped (no dimmer and the fluorescence is blinding.) If the goal of using synthetics is to produce a facsimile of known botanicals, missing the mark by a smidge doesn't read as a near miss, it reads as horrifying. Boucheron smells just like mid-1980s make-up looked: un-nuanced two-dimensional drawing on a three-dimensional figure. 19th March 201192412ADVERTISEMENTLisaandthewordShow all reviews1st try opening was great- really nice powdery orange floral Classy, comfy, fancy all at once. soft & feminine, a little sweet. potent sillage.

Dancing notes of floral, citrus, and it's slightly animalic. A joy to behold. A modern classic. You will be noticed, while wearing this one. It is a cloud of confidence. A storm of strength. It rains sensuality. 16th June 2017187757PerfumePorMoiShow all reviewsAs befitting its provenance, Boucheron's opening is loud and proud, a confident trumpeting of citrus and big flowers, underlain with a dissonant note of something sharp and woody/vegetal. I put that down to the basil–and maybe the geranium?–mucking about in all the \"pretty,\" but I'm only guessing based on the list of notes. I've worn this dozens of times, and I can't pick anything individual out. Except in the dry down, when Boucheron finally seems to have made it through the turbulence of its kitchen-sink composition and hit cruising altitude with its lushly sweet, powdery, orange creamsicle/vanilla/benzoin dry down. It's like what I always hope L'Heure Bleue will end up being before it devolves into wet pencil shavings.Fantastic bottle, too. 2nd March 2017183514Shifty BatShow all reviewsNothing really stands out to me in this creation, except maybe the impression that everything is in its right place; the basil and tuberose perfectly proportioned to accent and be accented by the sandal and civet, which are in turn toned down to watercolor with the use of iris and benzoin. It is sweet but not tacky, hazy but not at all indistinct. It's just a really well-made fruity floriental. It is rare that a fragrance can smell unmistakably like the 80's but not 'dated.' 14th February 2016168186JackTwistShow all reviewsBarbara Herman likes the combination of orange blossom and basil: the herb, plus the dryness of the cassis, bringing down the sweetness of the orange to an herbal base.

The green bitterness I initially don't like proves to make the scent balanced and harmonious as it develops.For that reason, Boucheron has taken the place in my perfume wardrobe of two older scents that were favorites of mine before reformulation - Must de Cartier and Estee Lauder Private Collection. The counterpoint of bitter green notes, white floral, and vanilla or amber is just so divine and velvety when it's done well, and it's certainly done well here.I hadn't grown into Boucheron yet when it launched, so can't compare the versions offhand, only know that I feel quite lucky to have it now as I've lost so many of my great ones, even my old vulgar orange blossom/green/vanilla favorite: the original Dior Addict. 8th July 2014143539Way Off ScenterShow all reviewsGenre: Floral OrientalBoucheron launches on a lovely honeyed neroli accord and fills out, via tuberose, tonka bean, and sandalwood, into a rich, mellow floral bouquet that rivals even Joy, Van Cleef & Arpels First, and Givenchy's Le De in depth and balance. The decadence of indole and the lightest touch of civet lend animalic warmth without distracting from the larger-than-life floral heart, while the silky sandalwood provides a dry counterpoint to what might otherwise have been an overly sweet and heady composition.Sillage and projection are both ample, though Boucheron is not of the same megaphone-wielding volume of its near contemporaries, Giorgio and Amarige. Boucheron endures well on the skin, with a smooth, sweet tonka (coumarin), resin, and musk drydown that generates an appealing warmth while avoiding any trace of the stuffiness that large scale white flower-centered floral-orientals sometimes lapse into. A worthy foray in a field made competitive by so many other classic entries.9th June 2014141290Lisa DPShow all reviewsI tried to wear Boucheron - for 2 years - in the early 1990s as a very young woman. Even then, at the height of my naiveté and arrogance, I knew it was just too big for me. Twenty years later, it may still be too big for me. But then as now, I appreciate Boucheron for the giant it is and was. My memory of it is pure elegance. Orange blossom and clotted cream. I do not remember any sharper notes, just a huge powdery blast that although it went through several incarnations of powder and cream, did not stray from that softness. I love Boucheron for the time of my life it represents. It brings a wry smile to my face when I think of the awkward, unsophisticated, younger me trying to fit such a pretentious, accomplished fragrance. 22nd January 2014135036ScentFanShow all reviewsBowled me overA saleswoman wafted some in my direction and I was a goner, images of operas, long gowns and jewelry immediately in my mind. At home I sang its praises and a bottle forthwith showed up. What a distinct, deep floral, not for the timid. Pros: Powerfully femaleCons: none\" 9th October 2013132255nonnativeShow all reviewsBoucheron should be a thumb up for a person like me, in love of strong and vintage parfumes. But it is a neutral. Perhaps is its too oldy drydown, perhaps is it to sweet and doesn't evolve well. There is something that doesn't intrigue me. Boucheron should be a floral but what I perceive is too heavy to remind me of flowers.What I appreciate is its warmth and class. And the beautiful rounded bottle that stands perfectly in my hand. A nice sensation: an object thought and designed having in mind the gestures of a lady spraying in front of the mirror. 29th January 2013123516bnusrShow all reviewsI might be yet to grow into this, though I'm no spring chook. It is uncompromising in its lack of top note frippery; it's straight and solidly to the point. With notes as deep and broad as these, it's surprising that there is not so much warmth. This is not so much sensual as forceful. If I were chairperson of a corporation, or party leader, this would tko any opposition before they had a chance to speak. Great psychological warfare.What made this perfume radiantly beautiful was for me starting out late one night by car on a rush trip to a film with a really good hot cup of espresso in my hand. The combination with Boucheron brought the Boucheron complexly and richly into my less prosaic, less disciplined world. A homecoming most wholeheartedly welcome.I love it, even if it's too ESTJ for me.30th December 2012121964willaFriendShow all reviewsStarted out quite nice. No burn on the initial spray. It settled into a soft powdery scent, which was pretty okay-ish, but then it transmogrified into a harsher version of those Necco wafers in the waxed paper tube. Spicy powdery candy. I guess that's the tonka bean rearing its massive head. Very robust. I tried to wash it off and it wouldn't go. Now I'm scared of it and hide behind a display case whenever I cross its path in a department store. Since I like it and cannot stand it at the same time, I'm giving it a neutral. 24th December 2012121689anomie et ivoireShow all reviewsViscous, plasticine, busier than a Byzantine mosaic and as finely wrought, but the buxom lavishness comes on like a bordello madame. And what is she selling? Boucheron has an amber agenda, a slick citrus schtick, oxymoronic or not vanillic dominatrix, bridesmaid fighting violently over maximalist white and orange bouquet gold digger slash murderess aspirations, and on and on. Thrilling on the right opera diva. For those less given to dancing in fountains in strapless gowns, original formula Rochas Byzance is a dreamlike, more nuanced take on post-opiated excess that I much prefer to Boucheron.21st November 2012120041india1939Show all reviewsI have worn this for year and have loved it....but the last two times I purchased it the scent seemed to dissipate quickly and the vanilla tones were missing. Is it me or have they changed the formula????? 4th November 2012119142PrimroseShow all reviewsBoucheron is a must for lovers of modern French perfumery. I has a lush and classical feel in the warmth and the rich florals of orange blossom and tuberose. \"The Guide\" rates this highly yet infers it is a bit obnoxious, describing being near someone wearing Boucheron is like being photographed next to a colossal marble foot as big as a car, but I disagree.I prefer the Boucheron in the EDP. It is indeed powerful, but it is glamourous and attracting notice. This is not for a wallflower. Apply to suit your skin and the weather and you won't knock anyone out. Instead, enjoy this opulent fragrance. 28th October 2012118708KarmaLeeShow all reviewsIt opens with a hint of floral (neroli?) and a touch of green bitter, then falls into a creamy oakmoss, sandalwood, teensy bit of civit loveliness. I just bought a small bottle of the EdP, and may be in love, and will be looking for more of the 1988 vintage juice.It moves through its notes, not in a linear from here to there way, but in a nice circle of effect. The neroli gives way to the green and that carries the flower and herb right into the spice/sweet benzoin bones of the composition.It projects well, and the drydown is lasting but not overpowerful. 20th March 2012107011dark phoenix 123Show all reviewsi had the chance to test both the vintage edp and edt recently. interestingly, i prefer the edt as the edp came across as sweeter, heavier and lacking in some the effervesence that the edt has. i ended up buying the vintage 75ml edt refillable. a classy oriental floral that does not smell like grandma! :) 21st December 2011102311DarvantShow all reviewsIn the same vein of the more severe, expansive (aldehydes) \"old fashioned\" and inflexible First, of the more mellifluous and indolic Amarige and of the slightly more dusty, rooty and animal Cassini, this  masterful and woodsy combination of the starring neroli, tuberose, smoky sandalwood and mossy benzoin discloses the renowned  and sophisticated  smell of the famous concoction. The general balance is sheer, the mildness is restrained by woods, the soapiness ( initially plain) is well combined with the other elements and with the creamy balsams,the sophistication is enhanced by a slightly rooty iris, the final powderiness is not exaggeratedly talky, the sensuality is exuded under appointment of a smart dosage of animal and tasty civet plus musk and amber, the smokiness is barely pushed up in order to set the bath soap kind of smell on the side of oakmoss and benzoin, in order to shadow the initial  white radiance and to tame the sweetness of florals and balsams. The initial blast of citrus is moderated in intensity and enveloped at once by a taming milky dust. The floral sumptuousity is supported by a radiant jasmine combined with the slightly exotic and tasty note of ylang-ylang. The last supposts the tastiness of vanilla and benzoin. The final issue is a boise' whiff of orangy balsams, sandalwood, soap and tuberose. Lemon, geranium, oakmoss, tonka and dry woods balance cleverly the mellifluence of the other elements. The tuberose is not \"criminelle\" but carefree and polite. Another great classic. 27th October 201199671Red TheodoraShow all reviewsBoucheron was and still is a lovely floral/oriental. I think you must a floral lover to truely appreciate this scent. I love that it starts out with a little kick of citrus with the floral accord swooping in right after. It's the oakmossy vanilla dry down, though, that I find so comforting. It's all in all a very well-structured fragrance! 19th August 201195948blood-orangeShow all reviewsThe previous reviews that highly praise this scent are definitely written by people with excellent taste in fragrances. Boucheron is a scent which defines sophistication, elegance and class. A rich, unmissable fragrance that doesn't have the popularity that it deserves.I spent many months searching for this particular fragrance, and only managed to find the EDT concentration in an exclusive fragrance boutique. I was highly impressed by the EDT, and when I read that the EDP is even more impressive, I can't help being dumbfounded by this scent.Boucheron is everything that a fragrance should be; complex, unique, intense and memorable. This fragrance has been created with the upmost care, blended beautifully, resulting in a rich, warm and feminine scent.The top notes are not your typical nose-burning citruses and fruits, they have all been blended perfectly creating a scent that is inviting and interesting. Vanilla makes it's presence known right from the very beginning. It's the combination of the vanilla mixed with the lemon, orange and basil and then with the floral accords in the heart of this scent, that fascinates me in so many ways.In no way is this fragrance dusty and 'old-smelling'. To describe this fragrance as being suited only to mature aged women is very misinformative. Any woman that loves this fragrance should be able to pull this off, it's not restricted to any age group.Everything from the scent to the bottle is clearly elegant and sophisticated, making this scent perfect for those strict formal events and occasions. It's such a shame that this fragrance isn't more readily available in my country, although I have heard that where it is available, it sells extremely well.Classic, Boucheron most certainly is. Expensive, but well worth the money spent. The lasting strength is guaranteed to be a highlight as it lasts well into the next day and clings to your clothes for days, managing to scent your wardrobe with its rich aroma.I highly recommend this fragrance and advise people that have not tried this scent to \"get thee to a tester immediately\", this perfume is not to be missed.3rd June 201192193jtdShow all reviewsUsing exclusively synthetic aromachemicals to make a perfume has benefits and risks. Tweaking abstract chemical components can allow for an interesting use of qualities to make a statement (eg. Lauder's Dazzling Silver or CdG's Synthetic Series.) The trap is in trying to recreate notes otherwise provided by botanicals. Simulation is risky against a known quantity. Boucheron attempts to make a floriental using flower-analogues and amber-analogues. These chemicals come off as both thin (no flesh to grab a hold of) and over-amped (no dimmer and the fluorescence is blinding.) If the goal of using synthetics is to produce a facsimile of known botanicals, missing the mark by a smidge doesn't read as a near miss, it reads as horrifying. Boucheron smells just like mid-1980s make-up looked: un-nuanced two-dimensional drawing on a three-dimensional figure. 19th March 201192412Weimar27Show all reviewsThey don't make them like these anymore the complex and multilayerd floral was so in vogue in the 80'sback then Perfume was an artistry they had the timeto examine and experiment every note possible in a Fragrance ranging from florals spices raisens and deep animalistic notes now modern perfumeryis a mere shadow of the glorious 80's now choked with watery fruity scent that has no charactor or silage hastely produced for the masses leaving art and more profit to the industry.But Boucheron is much more then that it's a relicto the past we need to make people aware that these gems exists and don't think of them as a granny perfume or it smells old and outdated look beyond those boundries and see what have you been missingbefore it gets discontinued.What surprises me about Boucheron is the notes complex yet well put together like well craftedjewelery or a finely chissled sculpture Boucheronis a work of art, It opens crisp with Bergamot sharpness of Lemon aromantic cassis and closing the openiing is zesty basil, in a few minutes dries fruity with apricots sweet but it does'nt overcloy tangerine with it's tangy nuances makes it's presence known there's a hint of spicy Gerainums noticible and add some spiciness to the perfume.Tuberose opens the heart of the fragrance with a buttery sweetness delicate note of jasmine gives an herbal feel and smell Narcissus dominates the middle notes almost drowning the others into obillvion with it's deep and intoxicating scent Lily of the Vally is the elusive note of all i can't dectect, the drydown to the ending sweetish with amber patches of musk and traces of Civet for animalitic properties Benzoin note makes the perfume a bit milky and resianious; the finishing notes of sandalwood adds the dryness and vanilla with it's powdery sweetness 6th March 201186408odysseusmShow all reviewsHere's an oriental I can whole-heartedly endorse. It is rich, smooth; yet not heavy and not too sweet. Lemon and light herbs mingle into well-blended florals. The tuberose and iris and handled with restraint (they don't dominate). A light mossy base is a lovely cushion for everything. Very chic and attractive. 31st January 201184078123 Next Most reviews in the last weekmanlyscents (8)Colbourne (8)Varanis Ridari (4)landshark321 (3)exmin (3)speedracer (3)RoamingRose (3)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)SPACEDOUT (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (28)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (8)Lian (7)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

Everything shades into everything else here – the light spiciness into a kind of herbal freshness, the ozonic wood note into the equally ozonic floral aspects, the fluffy patchouli (now there’s a contradiction in terms) into the thoroughly washed vetiver. This kind of strip-lit perfume is something of Quentin Bisch’s signature. Sometimes the results can have an intriguing, disorienting quality (as in his creations for Marc-Antoine Barrois). This is much safer – clean, crisp, office-friendly; or something I’d wear on an airplane trip so as not to offend my fellow passengers. Indeed, the drydown has a passing resemblance to my usual flight perfume – Timbutku – but with a sexy gruff smoke and pepper accord lingering at the back. 21st April 2024280225ADVERTISEMENTEd WardianShow all reviewsBois Impérial lives up to its billing. Here is a woody aromatic that brings the fresh tinny citrus flavour of Timur pepper to a punchy Thai basil crop that strongly vibrates like an ‘anisic’ metallic strum in its entire wearing, one that is vibed in Haitian vetiver strains, lumbered in spicy tones of cedar and akigalawood (a Givauden 'franken-note' that supposedly whiffs like a dry funk-less agarwood wrapped in leafy patchouli) and glazed in the ambroxan style of our futurismo. Truly, an alluring, breezy drone of woody reglisse and phantom allspice, and “Quentin’-sentially Bisch. 27th January 2024277328rogalalShow all reviewsA pleasant, strong mix of vetiver and Thai basil (the essential oil of which usually smells to me like mint) with an effervescent sparkle that recalls 7up. There's also a background sludge of chemicals, including something ozonic that reminds me of a hot computer, or maybe of plastic dishes on the verge of melting in a hot dishwasher. There's also a very modern musk element that reminds me of the rice milk musk of JHAG's Not A Perfume. Hours in, the basil and the sparkle fade, while that coconutty Australian sandalwood made famous by Santal 33 comes in, paired up with the plasticky chemicals and fading vetiver.I know this sounds unpleasant, but it works. The mix of ”real” and ”artificial” smells is handled well. That being said, it’s quite strong and, by day two, the chemical onslaught starts weighing thin. But I’m still voting thumbs up for a clever new take on vetiver. 8th June 2023273743SybzuenShow all reviewsCrisp, clean, woody and interesting. Smells like fresh air on a cool spring day in my opinion.Haven't smelled ganymede so cant compare them.Longevity also very very good.8,5/10 22nd February 2023270000Man Of The WorldShow all reviewsReally like this one! Hard to put my finger on it. Difficult to describe. Not that this fragrance is complex. It's just slightly unusual. Bois Imperial at its heart is a woody number. But not your typical woody. It is a fruity, sparkling, soapy woody. It's fresh and clean but has some subtle nuances which stop it becoming generic & boring.This stuff lasts for ages. Just keeps going. It's a real workhorse. I can see why so many people say they have received lots of compliments. Think it will please people around you. In many ways it reminds me of BR540. Not the scent profile as they smell nothing alike. It's just that they both have that ethereal vibe. You think it's not particularly strong so give yourself a few extra squirts and before you know it you are choking others out. It booms off the skin. Really hangs in the air. Great price too!! 20th November 2022266207speedracerShow all reviewsGrapefruit, and lemon pledge over fresh cut woods. Very dry. Starts off like a mix of Bvlgari Tygar and Cedrat Boise. It's very simple and linear though, I don't find that it has a complex drydown or evolution. Just less of the citrus topnotes as it dries.The most impressive thing about Bois Impérial is the performance. Just a couple of sprays will last all day and project. It is a pleasant scent but I think the projection and longevity are why this seems to garner compliments. I have not received one yet after a few wearings, truth be told, but I can see this working in that capacity. 14th October 2022265200aikj55Show all reviewsBanging good fragrance which reminds me of Ganymede but on a budget.Excellent for the warm weather and gathers compliments (if that's your thing), I highly recommend it. 17th July 2022261897WhiskyShow all reviewsJust got mine in today. Wearing it as I write this. Allthough some websites describe it as woody, that is not what I get out of it. It opens on my skin with a fresh citrus note. In my nose its more lime than grapefruit. But I do get grapefruit too. After about 1 hour I get crushed peppercorn. Then an earthy fresh patchouli. I was just at the local fishmongers (of all places) and a lady mentioned how nice I smelled. I had just picked it up from the post office and couldnt wait, and opened it and sprayed both wrists and a little on my neck. So the lady at the fishmongers liked it and could smell it above the fresh fish😀. So now I am two hours in and I am drinking a glass of Riesling. The two scents, Riesling and Bois Imperial go well together. Touch of mineral wine and peach. The Patchouli is making an entrance now. But not too strong. Just a side kick to the somewhat astringent leafyness. Far in the background is a touch of liquorice. Brilliant! Love it. This wont be my last bottle 14th July 2022270032Pippin06Show all reviewsThis reminds me of Terre d' Hermes, but I prefer this. The performance is outstanding--still enjoying lovely wafts 8 hours later with 2 to 3 sprays. Love the vetiver note in this composition--a smooth vetiver like I find in Tom Ford's Grey Vetiver, edp. I find this perfume uplifting. It's beautiful, and it makes me happy. Makes me think of enjoying dinner and wine at a charming outdoor French cafe under a moonlit, starry sky while listening to classic French songs being played on the accordion. IMO, Bois Imperial leans masculine, but I imagine it would smell amazing on a woman too. For a niche fragrance, the price is surprisingly affordable. Could be a new signature scent for me. update: Love this perfume more with each wearing. However, it projects better than I could have imagined. Go easy with this one. Finding 2 sprays is the limit.

Both perfumes have the same creator, one Quentin Bisch, who admittedly isn't my favorite guy in the scene even though he seems to get his name on a lot of fly-by-night perfumes lately. If you're looking for a somewhat reasonable fresh fragrance that isn't an aquatic or stuffed to the gizzard with sweet bubblegum or vanilla, this is a good choice, although that's the pinnacle of my assessment here.Essential Parfums sells itself as a budget-friendly niche alternative that packs all the creativity in fewer calories (dollars), being sort of the midway between a Byredo or Le Labo, and Dossier or Hawthorne; other non-descript bargain-basement brands that take \"pressed white shirt\" as a personality. The saving grace that keeps this somewhat interesting is that minty basil leaf, which is a staple of Thai cuisine (especially kaprow gai kai dao), tagged with vetiver and timut pepper. Beyond that, huge doses of ambrofix and akigalawood (a patchouli isolate that feels woody without the oiliness or camphor of whole patchouli). The laundry musk \"whoosh\" is just a bit much for me, as it stands so naked against the rest, becoming the focus. This stuff smells really freaking good in the air, so it's probably the compliment bomb the usual crowd is hoping for.As such, this formula feels a bit \"cheap\" to the nose, and you can get a little noseblind to it if you smell a whole bunch of it at once. People either scream this is a massive performer, or they can't smell it, and the sheer deafening hype all across the online fragrance enthusiast spaces (mostly brainless douchers looking to hook up or flex) puts a bit of a damper on the scent itself, although that's not brand's fault at all. I've never smelled this in the wild, so all that hype really just amounts to a hill of beans in the end, as people still fill the air with MFK Baccarat Rouge 540 (2015), Creed Aventus (2010), Dior Sauvage (2015), or the latest bubblegum showergel garbage. Nice concept, but not enough meat on them bones for me. Neutral 3rd June 2024281253ColbourneShow all reviewsWith such hype surrounding this one it was only a matter of time before I'd end up with a sample, and I must say, I don't dislike it. It does have the same high dose of Akigalawood as in Ganymede, however, that grates me. This molecular distilled isolate of patchouli feels vertiginous to me when generously added to compositions, and Quentin Bisch seems to have quite the penchant for it.There is a delightful, legible basil note that is a nice diversion from modern releases of this ilk; it's refreshing to have something so vital in an otherwise modernist and distant fragrance. Sure enough, this basil does quickly yield to the metallic wall of futurist woods and a vague, yet persistent freshness (hi, Ambroxan). It's definitely not speaking to me, but its popularity makes sense. 18th April 2023271607Most reviews in the last weekmanlyscents (8)Colbourne (8)Varanis Ridari (4)landshark321 (3)exmin (3)speedracer (3)RoamingRose (3)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)SPACEDOUT (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (28)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (8)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Lian (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

I can see why people like this. It's modern, attention grabbing in its own way, extremely potent (more on that later), and different--it doesn't smell like your typical mall scent. If all that sounds good to you, by all means sample. If you like it, grab a bottle - the price is good if you enjoy what you're smelling. You'll probably get compliments*, since everyone will smell this radiating off you, and you'll leave a glowing trail of aromachems in your wake.After coming close to blind buying, I am extremely grateful to a kind basenoter who sent me a sample first. This is easily the worst thing I've smelled since joining this site. A scrubber like no other made worse by the fact that it's impossible to scrub off. It smells like pesticide. Spicy, peppery chemicals that enflame the nostrils and crawl down your throat. It's not the vetiver, which is there, but stripped clean and fairly subdued. It's not the sharp basil either, which is probably the best part of the composition. Best I can tell, it's the megadose of akigalawood, which I now understand is a signature of perfumer Quentin Bisch, apparently dosed higher here than anywhere else. (Maybe Ganymede compares, as folks occasionally raise similar complaints, but I haven't tried it.) The overall effect is aggressively sharp and spicy but somehow hollow, like an incomplete fragrance made of peppery synthetic woods. More of an industrial smell than a perfume, it's like an AI-generated painting of a tree, if the AI were restricted to two colors and had no understanding that trees are living things.If that was it, just a sharp chemical smell I don't particularly care for, I could just shrug this off and move along. Not every scent is for everyone, who cares. I like plenty of minimalistic scents that others hate (Encre Noire, Tam Dao, many from Comme des Garcons), and it's fine if this one doesn't work for me. The issue is that when akigalawood is dosed this high and mated with ambroxan, the projection and longevity become positively nuclear. I'm convinced that most people wearing this are probably anosmic to some facet of the akigalawood, because most people aren't picking up the fact that this literally lasts weeks on fabric. This was my experience wearing it. Two sprays to the chest, and I enjoyed it at first, until the screechy bug spray note took over, and I realized it wasn't for me. Sat in it for about 6-8 hours, and finally scrubbed it off in the shower, toweled off, went to bed. The next morning I wake to the exact same smell, just as strong as when first applied. The scent had survived the shower and was now impregnated in the sheets. Yesterday's shirt was radiating from the laundry pile, and last night's towel positively reeked. Everything goes in the laundry, I took another shower... but no, there's no escape at this point. Days later, after multiple showers, this was still noticeable on my skin. My original t-shirt stank of bug spray for over a month, even though I washed it three times. It rubs off on anything you touch, and it will not die. The olfactory equivalent of an infectious, incurable disease.I've learned akigalawood can smell fine in reasonable doses, though it has a nose-tingling edge and is weirdly tenacious. I'm pretty sure I smell it in the base of Parfum d'Empire's Le Cri, one of my favorite light florals--even though the \"patchouli\" in the base will last days on clothing. I've seen others complain about the base of Beau du Jour (also akigalawood) surviving trips through laundry, leading to a a gradual accretion of olfactory funk over time. Clearly not everyone picks up on this, and that's probably a good thing. I would just warn you that even if you can't smell the peppery death that lies at the heart of Bois Imperial, at least some folks you encounter will. Parting story: a few months after my initial encounter, I'm heading towards my office elevator when the door opens, and I'm smacked in the face with a wave of Bois Imperial. Older executive-type gent gets off the elevator, oblivious to the strength of his perfume; and he had clearly sprayed heavily. Even after he left, it was hard to breathe in the elevator, and the scent lingered in my nose for 15 minutes and gave me headache. You have been warned!*Full disclosure: I did get compliments wearing this. It can smell pretty striking in the air, and people notice it. My daughter, who always tells me whether she loves or loathes whatever I'm wearing, smelled it on me and said it was one of the best perfumes she had ever smelled. C'est la vie. 5th November 2023275401TelumeeShow all reviewsIt smells synthetic. It's the first perfume in the last four dozen samples I've tried that's given me a headache. My favorite thing about it was the basil, but that didn't redeem it 7th June 2023273735ADVERTISEMENTtinfoilhatdudeShow all reviewsI bought this based on the many, many compliments that were reported. It's as if Bois Imperial is being crowned the next \"Aventus\" already.After 2 sprays on the first wearing(evening), I was almost ready to hop on that bandwagon. But now, as daylight and sobriety unfold new dimensions to this juice, I am running for the exit.Today, one full spray to the chest/next, one mist spray to the gut, bot under clothes. I now smell the Armaf style ingredients that are familiar with CDNIM; harsh and synthetic.5-6 sprays would fill a stadium, and I really wish I could go home and shower from 1.5 sprays.I really liked the bright, fizzy, sprightly opening from the other evening, but today it's just pest spray. The original wearing was as bright and fizzy as Givenchy Vetyver, but today I did not get that aura.I'm thinking climate and skin really effect these aromachems, so a strong try-before-you-buy from me. As I am averse to mall-counter \"Blues\", this must have something similar. So if Sauvage and BDC are your bag, this may be for you.To vintage and powerhouse snobs, try a free sample before jumping in, is my recommendation.5/10.

Indeed, the drydown has a passing resemblance to my usual flight perfume – Timbutku – but with a sexy gruff smoke and pepper accord lingering at the back. 21st April 2024280225ADVERTISEMENTEd WardianShow all reviewsBois Impérial lives up to its billing. Here is a woody aromatic that brings the fresh tinny citrus flavour of Timur pepper to a punchy Thai basil crop that strongly vibrates like an ‘anisic’ metallic strum in its entire wearing, one that is vibed in Haitian vetiver strains, lumbered in spicy tones of cedar and akigalawood (a Givauden 'franken-note' that supposedly whiffs like a dry funk-less agarwood wrapped in leafy patchouli) and glazed in the ambroxan style of our futurismo. Truly, an alluring, breezy drone of woody reglisse and phantom allspice, and “Quentin’-sentially Bisch. 27th January 2024277328rogalalShow all reviewsA pleasant, strong mix of vetiver and Thai basil (the essential oil of which usually smells to me like mint) with an effervescent sparkle that recalls 7up. There's also a background sludge of chemicals, including something ozonic that reminds me of a hot computer, or maybe of plastic dishes on the verge of melting in a hot dishwasher. There's also a very modern musk element that reminds me of the rice milk musk of JHAG's Not A Perfume. Hours in, the basil and the sparkle fade, while that coconutty Australian sandalwood made famous by Santal 33 comes in, paired up with the plasticky chemicals and fading vetiver.I know this sounds unpleasant, but it works. The mix of ”real” and ”artificial” smells is handled well. That being said, it’s quite strong and, by day two, the chemical onslaught starts weighing thin. But I’m still voting thumbs up for a clever new take on vetiver. 8th June 2023273743SybzuenShow all reviewsCrisp, clean, woody and interesting. Smells like fresh air on a cool spring day in my opinion.Haven't smelled ganymede so cant compare them.Longevity also very very good.8,5/10 22nd February 2023270000Man Of The WorldShow all reviewsReally like this one! Hard to put my finger on it. Difficult to describe. Not that this fragrance is complex. It's just slightly unusual. Bois Imperial at its heart is a woody number. But not your typical woody. It is a fruity, sparkling, soapy woody. It's fresh and clean but has some subtle nuances which stop it becoming generic & boring.This stuff lasts for ages. Just keeps going. It's a real workhorse. I can see why so many people say they have received lots of compliments. Think it will please people around you. In many ways it reminds me of BR540. Not the scent profile as they smell nothing alike. It's just that they both have that ethereal vibe. You think it's not particularly strong so give yourself a few extra squirts and before you know it you are choking others out. It booms off the skin. Really hangs in the air. Great price too!! 20th November 2022266207speedracerShow all reviewsGrapefruit, and lemon pledge over fresh cut woods. Very dry. Starts off like a mix of Bvlgari Tygar and Cedrat Boise. It's very simple and linear though, I don't find that it has a complex drydown or evolution. Just less of the citrus topnotes as it dries.The most impressive thing about Bois Impérial is the performance. Just a couple of sprays will last all day and project. It is a pleasant scent but I think the projection and longevity are why this seems to garner compliments. I have not received one yet after a few wearings, truth be told, but I can see this working in that capacity. 14th October 2022265200aikj55Show all reviewsBanging good fragrance which reminds me of Ganymede but on a budget.Excellent for the warm weather and gathers compliments (if that's your thing), I highly recommend it. 17th July 2022261897WhiskyShow all reviewsJust got mine in today. Wearing it as I write this. Allthough some websites describe it as woody, that is not what I get out of it. It opens on my skin with a fresh citrus note. In my nose its more lime than grapefruit. But I do get grapefruit too. After about 1 hour I get crushed peppercorn. Then an earthy fresh patchouli. I was just at the local fishmongers (of all places) and a lady mentioned how nice I smelled. I had just picked it up from the post office and couldnt wait, and opened it and sprayed both wrists and a little on my neck. So the lady at the fishmongers liked it and could smell it above the fresh fish😀. So now I am two hours in and I am drinking a glass of Riesling. The two scents, Riesling and Bois Imperial go well together. Touch of mineral wine and peach. The Patchouli is making an entrance now. But not too strong. Just a side kick to the somewhat astringent leafyness. Far in the background is a touch of liquorice. Brilliant! Love it. This wont be my last bottle 14th July 2022270032Pippin06Show all reviewsThis reminds me of Terre d' Hermes, but I prefer this. The performance is outstanding--still enjoying lovely wafts 8 hours later with 2 to 3 sprays. Love the vetiver note in this composition--a smooth vetiver like I find in Tom Ford's Grey Vetiver, edp. I find this perfume uplifting. It's beautiful, and it makes me happy. Makes me think of enjoying dinner and wine at a charming outdoor French cafe under a moonlit, starry sky while listening to classic French songs being played on the accordion. IMO, Bois Imperial leans masculine, but I imagine it would smell amazing on a woman too. For a niche fragrance, the price is surprisingly affordable. Could be a new signature scent for me. update: Love this perfume more with each wearing. However, it projects better than I could have imagined. Go easy with this one. Finding 2 sprays is the limit.

Both perfumes have the same creator, one Quentin Bisch, who admittedly isn't my favorite guy in the scene even though he seems to get his name on a lot of fly-by-night perfumes lately. If you're looking for a somewhat reasonable fresh fragrance that isn't an aquatic or stuffed to the gizzard with sweet bubblegum or vanilla, this is a good choice, although that's the pinnacle of my assessment here.Essential Parfums sells itself as a budget-friendly niche alternative that packs all the creativity in fewer calories (dollars), being sort of the midway between a Byredo or Le Labo, and Dossier or Hawthorne; other non-descript bargain-basement brands that take \"pressed white shirt\" as a personality. The saving grace that keeps this somewhat interesting is that minty basil leaf, which is a staple of Thai cuisine (especially kaprow gai kai dao), tagged with vetiver and timut pepper. Beyond that, huge doses of ambrofix and akigalawood (a patchouli isolate that feels woody without the oiliness or camphor of whole patchouli). The laundry musk \"whoosh\" is just a bit much for me, as it stands so naked against the rest, becoming the focus. This stuff smells really freaking good in the air, so it's probably the compliment bomb the usual crowd is hoping for.As such, this formula feels a bit \"cheap\" to the nose, and you can get a little noseblind to it if you smell a whole bunch of it at once. People either scream this is a massive performer, or they can't smell it, and the sheer deafening hype all across the online fragrance enthusiast spaces (mostly brainless douchers looking to hook up or flex) puts a bit of a damper on the scent itself, although that's not brand's fault at all. I've never smelled this in the wild, so all that hype really just amounts to a hill of beans in the end, as people still fill the air with MFK Baccarat Rouge 540 (2015), Creed Aventus (2010), Dior Sauvage (2015), or the latest bubblegum showergel garbage. Nice concept, but not enough meat on them bones for me.

It does have the same high dose of Akigalawood as in Ganymede, however, that grates me. This molecular distilled isolate of patchouli feels vertiginous to me when generously added to compositions, and Quentin Bisch seems to have quite the penchant for it.There is a delightful, legible basil note that is a nice diversion from modern releases of this ilk; it's refreshing to have something so vital in an otherwise modernist and distant fragrance. Sure enough, this basil does quickly yield to the metallic wall of futurist woods and a vague, yet persistent freshness (hi, Ambroxan). It's definitely not speaking to me, but its popularity makes sense. 18th April 2023271607Most reviews in the last weekmanlyscents (8)Colbourne (8)Varanis Ridari (4)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)landshark321 (3)exmin (3)speedracer (3)RoamingRose (3)SPACEDOUT (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (28)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)Callista25 (9)landshark321 (9)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (8)Lian (7)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

This is easily the worst thing I've smelled since joining this site. A scrubber like no other made worse by the fact that it's impossible to scrub off. It smells like pesticide. Spicy, peppery chemicals that enflame the nostrils and crawl down your throat. It's not the vetiver, which is there, but stripped clean and fairly subdued. It's not the sharp basil either, which is probably the best part of the composition. Best I can tell, it's the megadose of akigalawood, which I now understand is a signature of perfumer Quentin Bisch, apparently dosed higher here than anywhere else. (Maybe Ganymede compares, as folks occasionally raise similar complaints, but I haven't tried it.) The overall effect is aggressively sharp and spicy but somehow hollow, like an incomplete fragrance made of peppery synthetic woods. More of an industrial smell than a perfume, it's like an AI-generated painting of a tree, if the AI were restricted to two colors and had no understanding that trees are living things.If that was it, just a sharp chemical smell I don't particularly care for, I could just shrug this off and move along. Not every scent is for everyone, who cares. I like plenty of minimalistic scents that others hate (Encre Noire, Tam Dao, many from Comme des Garcons), and it's fine if this one doesn't work for me. The issue is that when akigalawood is dosed this high and mated with ambroxan, the projection and longevity become positively nuclear. I'm convinced that most people wearing this are probably anosmic to some facet of the akigalawood, because most people aren't picking up the fact that this literally lasts weeks on fabric. This was my experience wearing it. Two sprays to the chest, and I enjoyed it at first, until the screechy bug spray note took over, and I realized it wasn't for me. Sat in it for about 6-8 hours, and finally scrubbed it off in the shower, toweled off, went to bed. The next morning I wake to the exact same smell, just as strong as when first applied. The scent had survived the shower and was now impregnated in the sheets. Yesterday's shirt was radiating from the laundry pile, and last night's towel positively reeked. Everything goes in the laundry, I took another shower... but no, there's no escape at this point. Days later, after multiple showers, this was still noticeable on my skin. My original t-shirt stank of bug spray for over a month, even though I washed it three times. It rubs off on anything you touch, and it will not die. The olfactory equivalent of an infectious, incurable disease.I've learned akigalawood can smell fine in reasonable doses, though it has a nose-tingling edge and is weirdly tenacious. I'm pretty sure I smell it in the base of Parfum d'Empire's Le Cri, one of my favorite light florals--even though the \"patchouli\" in the base will last days on clothing. I've seen others complain about the base of Beau du Jour (also akigalawood) surviving trips through laundry, leading to a a gradual accretion of olfactory funk over time. Clearly not everyone picks up on this, and that's probably a good thing. I would just warn you that even if you can't smell the peppery death that lies at the heart of Bois Imperial, at least some folks you encounter will. Parting story: a few months after my initial encounter, I'm heading towards my office elevator when the door opens, and I'm smacked in the face with a wave of Bois Imperial. Older executive-type gent gets off the elevator, oblivious to the strength of his perfume; and he had clearly sprayed heavily. Even after he left, it was hard to breathe in the elevator, and the scent lingered in my nose for 15 minutes and gave me headache. You have been warned!*Full disclosure: I did get compliments wearing this. It can smell pretty striking in the air, and people notice it. My daughter, who always tells me whether she loves or loathes whatever I'm wearing, smelled it on me and said it was one of the best perfumes she had ever smelled.

My favorite thing about it was the basil, but that didn't redeem it 7th June 2023273735ADVERTISEMENTtinfoilhatdudeShow all reviewsI bought this based on the many, many compliments that were reported. It's as if Bois Imperial is being crowned the next \"Aventus\" already.After 2 sprays on the first wearing(evening), I was almost ready to hop on that bandwagon. But now, as daylight and sobriety unfold new dimensions to this juice, I am running for the exit.Today, one full spray to the chest/next, one mist spray to the gut, bot under clothes. I now smell the Armaf style ingredients that are familiar with CDNIM; harsh and synthetic.5-6 sprays would fill a stadium, and I really wish I could go home and shower from 1.5 sprays.I really liked the bright, fizzy, sprightly opening from the other evening, but today it's just pest spray. The original wearing was as bright and fizzy as Givenchy Vetyver, but today I did not get that aura.I'm thinking climate and skin really effect these aromachems, so a strong try-before-you-buy from me. As I am averse to mall-counter \"Blues\", this must have something similar. So if Sauvage and BDC are your bag, this may be for you.To vintage and powerhouse snobs, try a free sample before jumping in, is my recommendation.5/10.

It is a fruity, sparkling, soapy woody. It's fresh and clean but has some subtle nuances which stop it becoming generic & boring.This stuff lasts for ages. Just keeps going. It's a real workhorse. I can see why so many people say they have received lots of compliments. Think it will please people around you. In many ways it reminds me of BR540. Not the scent profile as they smell nothing alike. It's just that they both have that ethereal vibe. You think it's not particularly strong so give yourself a few extra squirts and before you know it you are choking others out. It booms off the skin. Really hangs in the air. Great price too!! 20th November 2022266207speedracerShow all reviewsGrapefruit, and lemon pledge over fresh cut woods. Very dry. Starts off like a mix of Bvlgari Tygar and Cedrat Boise. It's very simple and linear though, I don't find that it has a complex drydown or evolution. Just less of the citrus topnotes as it dries.The most impressive thing about Bois Impérial is the performance. Just a couple of sprays will last all day and project. It is a pleasant scent but I think the projection and longevity are why this seems to garner compliments. I have not received one yet after a few wearings, truth be told, but I can see this working in that capacity. 14th October 2022265200tinfoilhatdudeShow all reviewsI bought this based on the many, many compliments that were reported. It's as if Bois Imperial is being crowned the next \"Aventus\" already.After 2 sprays on the first wearing(evening), I was almost ready to hop on that bandwagon. But now, as daylight and sobriety unfold new dimensions to this juice, I am running for the exit.Today, one full spray to the chest/next, one mist spray to the gut, bot under clothes. I now smell the Armaf style ingredients that are familiar with CDNIM; harsh and synthetic.5-6 sprays would fill a stadium, and I really wish I could go home and shower from 1.5 sprays.I really liked the bright, fizzy, sprightly opening from the other evening, but today it's just pest spray. The original wearing was as bright and fizzy as Givenchy Vetyver, but today I did not get that aura.I'm thinking climate and skin really effect these aromachems, so a strong try-before-you-buy from me. As I am averse to mall-counter \"Blues\", this must have something similar. So if Sauvage and BDC are your bag, this may be for you.To vintage and powerhouse snobs, try a free sample before jumping in, is my recommendation.5/10. Worth the money at half the current prices or less. 30th August 2022263655aikj55Show all reviewsBanging good fragrance which reminds me of Ganymede but on a budget.Excellent for the warm weather and gathers compliments (if that's your thing), I highly recommend it. 17th July 2022261897WhiskyShow all reviewsJust got mine in today. Wearing it as I write this. Allthough some websites describe it as woody, that is not what I get out of it. It opens on my skin with a fresh citrus note. In my nose its more lime than grapefruit. But I do get grapefruit too. After about 1 hour I get crushed peppercorn. Then an earthy fresh patchouli. I was just at the local fishmongers (of all places) and a lady mentioned how nice I smelled. I had just picked it up from the post office and couldnt wait, and opened it and sprayed both wrists and a little on my neck. So the lady at the fishmongers liked it and could smell it above the fresh fish😀. So now I am two hours in and I am drinking a glass of Riesling. The two scents, Riesling and Bois Imperial go well together. Touch of mineral wine and peach. The Patchouli is making an entrance now. But not too strong. Just a side kick to the somewhat astringent leafyness. Far in the background is a touch of liquorice. Brilliant! Love it. This wont be my last bottle 14th July 2022270032Pippin06Show all reviewsThis reminds me of Terre d' Hermes, but I prefer this. The performance is outstanding--still enjoying lovely wafts 8 hours later with 2 to 3 sprays. Love the vetiver note in this composition--a smooth vetiver like I find in Tom Ford's Grey Vetiver, edp. I find this perfume uplifting. It's beautiful, and it makes me happy. Makes me think of enjoying dinner and wine at a charming outdoor French cafe under a moonlit, starry sky while listening to classic French songs being played on the accordion. IMO, Bois Imperial leans masculine, but I imagine it would smell amazing on a woman too. For a niche fragrance, the price is surprisingly affordable. Could be a new signature scent for me. update: Love this perfume more with each wearing. However, it projects better than I could have imagined. Go easy with this one. Finding 2 sprays is the limit. And, it lasts! 7th May 2022258625Most reviews in the last weekmanlyscents (8)Colbourne (8)Varanis Ridari (4)landshark321 (3)exmin (3)speedracer (3)RoamingRose (3)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)SPACEDOUT (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (28)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (8)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Lian (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

Discontinued masterpiece. Sell some plasma, buy a bottle, take it to a bespoke perfumer, make them copy it for you, strike fear in the hearts of men, reign supreme. I rue the day Gucci discontinued this. 6th April 2021241104Brian BuchananShow all reviewsA sour green floral of three parts : a bitter brown base, a green accord and a sour floral. The floral is a magnolia bouquet, made sour by sharp lilac, fugitive hyacinth and fake citrus. There's also cold iris and a green accord based on shiny muguet leaf. But Envy is not just sour and green, it's one of the driest florals around. There's a bitter black note in the magnolia petal - which adds a gritty edge - and this is worked into a kind of burnt-sugar mossy base, which is anything but sweet. In fact, what sweetness there is, is only there to stop the tamarisk note from getting out of hand, nothing more. But, even though it's bold and striking, Envy's not as original as it seems. It's like green l'Eau d'issey, which is set on a base of scorched earth that clearly derives from Sinan. On the other hand, what is different about Envy is - it doesn't try to smell nice. By flouting the idea that it 'should always smell good' Envy places itself firmly in the difficult - or Expressionist camp - along with some of Roudnitska's work, Sécrétions, Poison etc. And of course it was a big success, which goes to show that a safe perfume isn't always the most lucrative one. Back in 1997, it seems the public had an unhealthy appetite for 'mean and nasty' as well as pink fluff and candyfloss, and we see the same thing happening today with the Spiky Woods. The smell may be different - but the spirit is the same; just the materials have changed - for the worse.Aggressive and mean, Envy was a success - because of its faults - and not despite them. And they are what make it so distinctive and memorable. ***** 16th October 2019266799ADVERTISEMENTramin1215Show all reviewsCostume design for the ballet \"Mad Tristan\" by Salvador Dali 3rd May 2018201042OviattShow all reviewsThis sweet, soft green floral is from 1997 but if you changed the '97 to '79, it would totally make sense. This throwback to the 70s, that Tom Ford does so well, should be evident from the first glimpse of his spare, chrome-capped bottle. The big floral notes--Hyacinth and Muguet--could easily take the bit between their teeth and make a run for it, but in Roucel's hands they are so well blended and harmonious that they are real team players. Does it smell a bit like expensive shampoo? Absolutely. Imagine a woman who has just stepped out of the shower at a first class hotel, say, the George V. In 1979. She wraps herself in a luxurious white robe while she ponders what to wear that night (does she wear the Castelbajac or the Sonia Rykiel? Her Maud Frizon snakeskin sandals or the gold leather Charles Jourdan pumps?). Before the makeup, before she lights her first cigarette of the evening, before she pours herself a Dubonnet and before she douses herself with Calandre, she smells like this--fresh, floral, clean..... 23rd January 2016167235Shifty BatShow all reviewsI like Envy. I like it because it is unambitious yet different from the modern climes. It is an almost entirely floral composition, in a throwback way which somehow casts an unassailable aura around the wearer, like a vampiric woman whose creation and heart are rooted in the 40's, and who walks the Earth unchanged, unmoved. I also like that it is like an echo, growing smaller and more distant, as hour by hour the bittersweet petals are stripped away, layer after layer, until all that is left is a cool and pleasant iris, like the core of an old Guerlain. 30th December 2015166182Way Off ScenterShow all reviewsGenre: Green FloralEnvy is a massive sweet green floral scent with abundant sillage and powerful projection. It's quick to fill a room, but the essential bitterness of its green notes keeps it from becoming crude or cloying. In other words, it's a fine example of Maurice Roucel in his expansive mood  the same one in which he composed Insolence and Musc Ravageur. Envy's floral notes include bold jasmine and orange blossom which bear a hefty load of fleshy indoles. These give Envy a decadent, lascivious undertone that balances out it's clean, green attributes. The tension between Envy's green and animalic faces makes wearing it an enthralling experience. I find myself waiting expectantly for one of the two sides to take over and throw the balance, but the suspense does not subside until the entire composition retreats into its relatively simple, pastel green, coumarin-tinged drydown. An altogether pleasant scent, and one I'm comfortable wearing (in small doses) as a man.13th June 2014141714GrottolaShow all reviewsProbably the greatest green floral ever made, except for maybe Chamade by Guerlain. This one isn't harsh at all, and it's not too powdery or heavy on galbanum like many of its ilk. It's simply a smooth, grassy-green lily fragrance that pumps out decent enough longevity and still smells pretty natural. While Envy is a pretty \"safe\" fragrance, it doesn't really need to be obtrusive or make a huge statement. It takes some talent to be able to create a green floral so pleasant yet natural and soft-spoken. If you can find it, then get it, at least for reference. Even if you're a dude. 25th September 2012117162emelleShow all reviewsmy perfume choices are different from my mother.but this one is the one we love both. it is soft floral clean and refreshing. it smells like wind on spring. smells so young and tender. 3rd July 2012113087alfaromShow all reviewsHenry Matisse used to say: \"Don't try to be original. Be simple. Be good technically, and if there is something in you, it will come out\". Envy is a simple masterpiece. It opens with a sour, sort of unripe, pear/apple accord that is quickly joined by bitter green notes, jasmine and other florals. For a few moments it immediately reminded me of Chanel No.19 but where the Chanel strikes as incredibly serious, the Gucci introduces a light-hearted vibe that gives this composition more versatility. At the same time Roucel is is able to avoid the youthful allure of many compositions of the same genre by balancing the overall freshness with an indolic element that adds a solid consitency to the whole composition. Overall Envy is potent, long lasting and distinctive...Just perfect. Does great also on a man.11th November 2011100433blood-orangeShow all reviewsI don't usually like fresh, green scents, however in this situation I really enjoyed wearing Envy.Upon first application, Envy is very green and quite refreshing. The fruits balance themselves out nicely along with the magnolia and freesia. Thankfully pineapple is a subtle note here, because with most perfumes pineapple likes to rear its ugly head and cause me to dislike a scent.As the fragrance settles on the skin it becomes increasingly grassy, but not sharp like Chanel No.19. Envy is tame and polite, it doesn't like to make a loud, obtrusive statement. Envy feels very modern for its time. Its slight metallic-like quality captivates me. Although Envy is something that I probably wouldn't wear, I am very intrigued by it. Envy fascinated me from the very beginning to the very end.The lasting strength is average, if not a little better than average. Like I mentioned before this isn't a particularly strong scent, so I'd say it is fairly intimate. A green floral that I do surprisingly recommend.26th June 201193368asilverfire614Show all reviewsI tested this the other day and didn't expect to lie it at all. I've never been a huge fan of Gucci fragrances, and I've never been a huge fan of floral greens in general. They almost always smell unpleasant to me. That being said, I LOVE IT! The opening was as green as it could be without burning my nose hairs, and I actually liked it. I don't know what makes this one different, but it made me feel very confident...bold...in a no-nonsense kind of way. It was sharp and bitter but incredibly sexy and feminine at the same time. The floral dry-down was very pleasant as well and it lasted all day on me. I see this as being a great summer fragrance to add to my collection!Jan032009 27th March 201188126Nile_EtlandShow all reviewsThis is another one of those fragrances that seems to be different every time I wear it. Is it the weather or just the mood I'm in? I can't say. I don't think this will ever be my No.1 can't-live-without-it fragrance but I like it a lot and was delighted to pick up a bottle at TK Max. It starts off fresh and light, then after a few moments a deeper powdery note comes through and the two seem to oscillate - some days the freshness and fruit seem to predominate, sometimes the powdery note. I don't know whether this is a typical Gucci fragrance, it's the only Gucci I've got so I've got nothing to compare it to, but for me it makes that 'fresh out of the shower' feeling last all day. It's a fresh daytime scent, unlikely to offend anyone sitting near you at the theatre or dining at the next table. For evening I prefer something a bit richer and more feminine but I'm very happy with my bargain buy for daytime wear and (if I come across another cheap, whether at TK Max or on the Net) I may indulge myself again.27th February 201186033odysseusmShow all reviewsA lovely, pretty scent. Green, translucent, spring flowers suggesting lily of the valley.Not too sweet, could be unisex if the man is feeling cheery. Very nice. 10th January 201182432vintage*redShow all reviewsWhat a beautiful floral! It is green and translucent. It emphasizes white florals but is balanced by iris. It reminds me of Ivoire but it does not turn soapy or powdery or sour. Envy somehow walks the fine line between old fashioned and modern. She manages to walk that line with unusual grace & charm. The pure parfum is soft & beautiful. The edt is bright & cheerful. My only regret is the modest longevity for the edt. The edp is STRONG with incredible longevity. Gucci no longer carries Envy on their website, so get it while you can. 23rd December 201081309foetidusShow all reviewsVery, very nice–Envy is an excellent green / fresh fragrance. The fruits of the opening are kept at a tasteful minimum, signifying that this will not be one of the many sweet fruity floral fragrances that can be found almost everywhere. This fragrance takes its own path. The florals, too, are restrained and subtle, and they, along with the iris from the base form a wonderfully neutral accord that I don't know how to describe. It reminds me of the papyrus notes of some fragrances–or a premium bond paper or perhaps a dryer sheet that's very high-end, if you can imagine such a thing. This deluxe neutral note serves as a platform for displaying the richness and depth of the muted fruit in the top and the discreet woods and musk in the base. This carries the inventive transparent floral accord of L'Eau d'Issey one step further by further neutralizing individual notes in order to gain these beautifully compelling translucent combination accords. The whole neutral floral / paper thing is very successfully accomplished in Envy, because it results in a progression that is both elegant and casual at the same time. Sophistication and ease in one and the same traditionally structured progression. Possible synthetics aside, I believe Envy was ground breaking when it was introduced, and it has remained a wonderful and special feminine fragrance.Originally submitted 24 May 20073rd December 201079956jtdShow all reviewsWhy is this called Envy? Should it inspire envy? Symbolize envy? Should I value envy? Sounds much more like a Calvin Klein fragrance wanna-be name, but I bought it, so who's to say the marketing didn't work? No. 19 is a sharp green floral, PR Metal is a flinty green floral, Alliage is a cool green floral. Envy is a sour green floral. Bitter works wonderfully in perfume, hence all the great leathers and chypres. Sour is another story entirely. Sour, as in acidic, can add balance to food, but doesn't really have a comparable place in fragrance. It's sort of like coffee in that respect. Bitter coffee is an ideal, sour coffee is a shame. But the sourness here adds a bit of fruit that ties together the green and white florals and makes the whole thing soapy, if a bit cold. I wear it occasionally, and, interestingly, this is one of the few fragrances that people smell on me (a man) and comment positively on. I think sour reads to some people as a sibling tone to the popular fresh and sport. I come back to this one occasionally, but I've never really grown fond of it. It is an insecticide-like floral, with references to floral notes but not the feel of bloom to it. I think it is the soapiness that makes me not write it off, but I can't say it is an enjoyable fragrance.29th November 2010150715BetsyMeszarosShow all reviewsI can never decide about Envy. It is seductive. Something you want to resist but can't. It seems like a sophisticated worldly scent to me. It seems like something I can't get my head around. I don't know if I like it but I think I love it. Like some guy you use for sex but on the other hand like some guy you want to always be there and you can't resist even though you know he's bad. 26th September 2010150952RRBShow all reviewsI was put off Envy for a long time because I saw it as heavily commercial and ubiquitous... as others have written it was the sickeningly distinctive smell of glossy department stores in my late teens and early 20s. But I had always been surprised by how much I liked it - and when a friend offered me some half-used bottles (\"cats' piss\" she declared) I was keen. It's gorgeous... Cristalle overlaid with some ripe fruit (melon? apples?) and underlaid with sweet woods and musk. I've pondered the name - I think it works with the obvious association with green, but doesn't conjure the fragrance's warmer, sunnier, fat character. (The chiselled models faking the throes of passion in the ads don't really fit the smell either.) It also reminds me of another fruity chypre - Parfum de Nicolai's Vie de Chateau - which combines ripe fruit, hay, and greenery. I take the point of reviewers like Chandler Burr and Bois de Jasmin that Envy redefines what we think of 'florals' - the heady, edible warmth of hyacinth that is not at all sentimental weak pastels... 27th March 201075283Bushido MidoriShow all reviewsI apply Envy when i wear leather. Strong and willful scent,not really for everyone,cause it can outdo person wearing it. It has some of that new-age style when it comes to perfume designing,light( it doesnt summon clouds,sea and wind,but unique sense of confidence,that makes anything at ease in this world ) and full of attitude. Well executed and blended. Beautiful suillage,fair longevity. 7th January 201074867TortolaShow all reviewsI wore Envy a lot in my 20s and to me it is a sexy green tea scent (if such a thing is possible!). It oozes money and sophiscation and just doesn't smell like anything else, which is always a good thing as far as I'm concerned. I wouldn't wear it now but it's still great. Gotta love Maurice Roucel for this one. 12th December 200974393privateblendShow all reviewsEnvy started strong,Loud and high pitched.But I give it a minute or two to cool off and I was surprised.Envy turned out to be a smooth and cold scent. It smells like frosted metal, the kind that is cool and pleasent to touch but with an added sweetness to it. It can be considered aloof but underneath all the cool attitude there is a pleasant husky texture to the scent, only a bit, a throaty chuckle instead of a shrieking laughters.It is nothing short of a masterpiece. 25th November 200960305DiamondflameShow all reviewsThe brief to Maurice Roucel must have been very brief indeed, probably just that single word: ENVY. For Roucel seems to have had pretty much a free hand in this undertaking, opting for the easier no-brainer option to draw upon the oft-quoted phrase, 'green with envy'. And that's what we got here, folks - a green floral. But unlike the fresh effervescence of Tommy Girl's spring morning, Envy is more about spring evenings with dusk approaching, flowers in late bloom, a peach ripening on a stem, mayhap a touch synthetic but still lactonic. I find the musky and powdery heart addictive and kept sniffing myself every few minutes. But far from being a happy scent, Envy's dusky yet seductive demeanour hints at darker secrets, of desires and longings and quite possibly, envy. A wearable if somewhat seductive scent that comes across as 'young'. On a sultry beauty, I could even imagine Envy as the embodiment of a third-party aka the 'husband-stealer'. Now if that isn't something that elicits envy, I don't know what is. 12th November 200970027AshaShow all reviewsGucci EnvyNotes: Hyacinth, Magnolia, Lily of the Valley, Jasmine, Violet, Iris (from sephora.com)I have to be very honest. I do not smell anything like what is listed in the notes for Gucci Envy. When I first spray it, I smell something like waxed Granny Smith apples and plastic screechy florals. In the drydown I smell vestiges of the plastic top notes along with an extremely \"perfumey\" synthetic powder note and nondescript sweet musk. I can't say it is completely unpleasant, but here's what's really interesting about Envy...Envy smells like the fragrance counter at Macy's. In other words, it smells like a cloud of fragrance which is composed of countless spray-testing all the more recent fragrances available at a mid-level department store. This is the PURE ESSENCE OF MALL smell. I have to give some kudos for being able to bottle such a nebulous thing. It's definitely not for me, but I can understand the appeal. 30th October 200950092SporenburgShow all reviewsI bought this for my wife when it came out, mainly because I was curious what Gucci, in the middle of a creative rebirth, was doing in the area of fragrance. Well, they created a classic. Such a beautiful fragrance and one that for once deserves the description modern (most of the time a word mistaken with current fashion, and most new fragrances don't deserve to be called modern.) This truly is a stylish fragrance for women that, once and for all, ends the tradition of musty, female perfume. This is crisp, green, sharp but unmistakably female. Undeniably great (too bad the male version wasn't any good.) 16th May 20096689812 Next Most reviews in the last weekmanlyscents (8)Colbourne (8)Varanis Ridari (4)landshark321 (3)exmin (3)speedracer (3)RoamingRose (3)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)sakecat (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (28)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (8)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Lian (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

So I shoved it to the back of my perfume collection and haven't touched it for a couple of years. I hauled it out yesterday and dusted it off. It's still pretty, but it's very white-flowery on me  I don't get any pineapple or rose or sandalwood or pretty much any of the other notes. And I think I've figured out why it irritated me  a) the white flowers take over after half an hour or so, b) it barely lasted four hours and c) what was left took on a rather sharp, almost-but-not-quite sour green edge. I'm going to try layering it with something else to see what happens, as the first half hour of this is rather lovely. If anybody has any suggestions, I'd be happy to try them. 25th September 2016177259JackTwistShow all reviewsThis is a nice sweet green floral that to my nose combines an apple note with a muguet note, though oddly apple is not listed as an ingredient.Barbara Herman finds this a tart green rose with a powdery anise dry down. My nose does not relate to any of those impressions. On me it is a pleasant green fruity floral, no better or worse than any of the dozens of other perfumes I have experienced in that category. It is definitely a young smell - I can see it working perfectly on a young, vibrant woman in her twenties.Herman also comes up with lots more notes than on this Basenotes page: galbanum, coriander, anise, celery, violet leaf, rose, cumin.Turin describes it simply as a \"green floral\" but gives it 5 stars. A bit overboard in my estimation.Ultimately, a nice fruity floral, tart and joyful - the scent arising from an apple or pear one has just crunched into. 30th June 2014143011ADVERTISEMENTpabloShow all reviewsgood fragance..couldnt use it myself ..too femenine..reminds me of a more trashypolo sport woman... 2nd April 201045363ElizaShow all reviewsIt's a lovely scent but I had to get rid of it because I always felt like I was smelling someone elses perfume.

Envy's dominant notes of magnolia, jasmine, orange blossom, and Cox apple, smell like they were sourced from an Excel spreadsheet rather than from a garden, more artificial than truly abstract, and the total effect is that of hair styling mousse. But it is also of its time and probably a fair snapshot of mainstream perfumery in the 1990s, acquired and exhibited in shopping malls, our new cathedrals, with fragrances just like Gucci's Envy standing in as their incense.28th July 201194906takemyhusbandplzShow all reviewsI had to try this based on how much I loved Gucci Accenti. I thought I'd love this one as well. Sadly Envy did not work at all for me. The synthetic iris and musk combined to overpower every other note on my skin. Definitely not good!

I rue the day Gucci discontinued this. 6th April 2021241104Brian BuchananShow all reviewsA sour green floral of three parts : a bitter brown base, a green accord and a sour floral. The floral is a magnolia bouquet, made sour by sharp lilac, fugitive hyacinth and fake citrus. There's also cold iris and a green accord based on shiny muguet leaf. But Envy is not just sour and green, it's one of the driest florals around. There's a bitter black note in the magnolia petal - which adds a gritty edge - and this is worked into a kind of burnt-sugar mossy base, which is anything but sweet. In fact, what sweetness there is, is only there to stop the tamarisk note from getting out of hand, nothing more. But, even though it's bold and striking, Envy's not as original as it seems. It's like green l'Eau d'issey, which is set on a base of scorched earth that clearly derives from Sinan. On the other hand, what is different about Envy is - it doesn't try to smell nice. By flouting the idea that it 'should always smell good' Envy places itself firmly in the difficult - or Expressionist camp - along with some of Roudnitska's work, Sécrétions, Poison etc. And of course it was a big success, which goes to show that a safe perfume isn't always the most lucrative one. Back in 1997, it seems the public had an unhealthy appetite for 'mean and nasty' as well as pink fluff and candyfloss, and we see the same thing happening today with the Spiky Woods. The smell may be different - but the spirit is the same; just the materials have changed - for the worse.Aggressive and mean, Envy was a success - because of its faults - and not despite them. And they are what make it so distinctive and memorable. ***** 16th October 2019266799ADVERTISEMENTramin1215Show all reviewsCostume design for the ballet \"Mad Tristan\" by Salvador Dali 3rd May 2018201042OviattShow all reviewsThis sweet, soft green floral is from 1997 but if you changed the '97 to '79, it would totally make sense. This throwback to the 70s, that Tom Ford does so well, should be evident from the first glimpse of his spare, chrome-capped bottle. The big floral notes--Hyacinth and Muguet--could easily take the bit between their teeth and make a run for it, but in Roucel's hands they are so well blended and harmonious that they are real team players. Does it smell a bit like expensive shampoo? Absolutely. Imagine a woman who has just stepped out of the shower at a first class hotel, say, the George V. In 1979. She wraps herself in a luxurious white robe while she ponders what to wear that night (does she wear the Castelbajac or the Sonia Rykiel? Her Maud Frizon snakeskin sandals or the gold leather Charles Jourdan pumps?). Before the makeup, before she lights her first cigarette of the evening, before she pours herself a Dubonnet and before she douses herself with Calandre, she smells like this--fresh, floral, clean..... 23rd January 2016167235Shifty BatShow all reviewsI like Envy. I like it because it is unambitious yet different from the modern climes. It is an almost entirely floral composition, in a throwback way which somehow casts an unassailable aura around the wearer, like a vampiric woman whose creation and heart are rooted in the 40's, and who walks the Earth unchanged, unmoved. I also like that it is like an echo, growing smaller and more distant, as hour by hour the bittersweet petals are stripped away, layer after layer, until all that is left is a cool and pleasant iris, like the core of an old Guerlain. 30th December 2015166182Way Off ScenterShow all reviewsGenre: Green FloralEnvy is a massive sweet green floral scent with abundant sillage and powerful projection. It's quick to fill a room, but the essential bitterness of its green notes keeps it from becoming crude or cloying. In other words, it's a fine example of Maurice Roucel in his expansive mood  the same one in which he composed Insolence and Musc Ravageur. Envy's floral notes include bold jasmine and orange blossom which bear a hefty load of fleshy indoles. These give Envy a decadent, lascivious undertone that balances out it's clean, green attributes. The tension between Envy's green and animalic faces makes wearing it an enthralling experience. I find myself waiting expectantly for one of the two sides to take over and throw the balance, but the suspense does not subside until the entire composition retreats into its relatively simple, pastel green, coumarin-tinged drydown. An altogether pleasant scent, and one I'm comfortable wearing (in small doses) as a man.13th June 2014141714GrottolaShow all reviewsProbably the greatest green floral ever made, except for maybe Chamade by Guerlain. This one isn't harsh at all, and it's not too powdery or heavy on galbanum like many of its ilk. It's simply a smooth, grassy-green lily fragrance that pumps out decent enough longevity and still smells pretty natural. While Envy is a pretty \"safe\" fragrance, it doesn't really need to be obtrusive or make a huge statement. It takes some talent to be able to create a green floral so pleasant yet natural and soft-spoken. If you can find it, then get it, at least for reference. Even if you're a dude. 25th September 2012117162emelleShow all reviewsmy perfume choices are different from my mother.but this one is the one we love both. it is soft floral clean and refreshing. it smells like wind on spring. smells so young and tender. 3rd July 2012113087alfaromShow all reviewsHenry Matisse used to say: \"Don't try to be original. Be simple. Be good technically, and if there is something in you, it will come out\". Envy is a simple masterpiece. It opens with a sour, sort of unripe, pear/apple accord that is quickly joined by bitter green notes, jasmine and other florals. For a few moments it immediately reminded me of Chanel No.19 but where the Chanel strikes as incredibly serious, the Gucci introduces a light-hearted vibe that gives this composition more versatility. At the same time Roucel is is able to avoid the youthful allure of many compositions of the same genre by balancing the overall freshness with an indolic element that adds a solid consitency to the whole composition. Overall Envy is potent, long lasting and distinctive...Just perfect. Does great also on a man.11th November 2011100433blood-orangeShow all reviewsI don't usually like fresh, green scents, however in this situation I really enjoyed wearing Envy.Upon first application, Envy is very green and quite refreshing. The fruits balance themselves out nicely along with the magnolia and freesia. Thankfully pineapple is a subtle note here, because with most perfumes pineapple likes to rear its ugly head and cause me to dislike a scent.As the fragrance settles on the skin it becomes increasingly grassy, but not sharp like Chanel No.19. Envy is tame and polite, it doesn't like to make a loud, obtrusive statement. Envy feels very modern for its time. Its slight metallic-like quality captivates me. Although Envy is something that I probably wouldn't wear, I am very intrigued by it. Envy fascinated me from the very beginning to the very end.The lasting strength is average, if not a little better than average.

The opening was as green as it could be without burning my nose hairs, and I actually liked it. I don't know what makes this one different, but it made me feel very confident...bold...in a no-nonsense kind of way. It was sharp and bitter but incredibly sexy and feminine at the same time.

I see this as being a great summer fragrance to add to my collection!Jan032009 27th March 201188126Nile_EtlandShow all reviewsThis is another one of those fragrances that seems to be different every time I wear it. Is it the weather or just the mood I'm in? I can't say. I don't think this will ever be my No.1 can't-live-without-it fragrance but I like it a lot and was delighted to pick up a bottle at TK Max. It starts off fresh and light, then after a few moments a deeper powdery note comes through and the two seem to oscillate - some days the freshness and fruit seem to predominate, sometimes the powdery note. I don't know whether this is a typical Gucci fragrance, it's the only Gucci I've got so I've got nothing to compare it to, but for me it makes that 'fresh out of the shower' feeling last all day. It's a fresh daytime scent, unlikely to offend anyone sitting near you at the theatre or dining at the next table. For evening I prefer something a bit richer and more feminine but I'm very happy with my bargain buy for daytime wear and (if I come across another cheap, whether at TK Max or on the Net) I may indulge myself again.27th February 201186033odysseusmShow all reviewsA lovely, pretty scent. Green, translucent, spring flowers suggesting lily of the valley.Not too sweet, could be unisex if the man is feeling cheery. Very nice. 10th January 201182432vintage*redShow all reviewsWhat a beautiful floral! It is green and translucent. It emphasizes white florals but is balanced by iris. It reminds me of Ivoire but it does not turn soapy or powdery or sour. Envy somehow walks the fine line between old fashioned and modern. She manages to walk that line with unusual grace & charm. The pure parfum is soft & beautiful. The edt is bright & cheerful. My only regret is the modest longevity for the edt. The edp is STRONG with incredible longevity. Gucci no longer carries Envy on their website, so get it while you can. 23rd December 201081309foetidusShow all reviewsVery, very nice–Envy is an excellent green / fresh fragrance. The fruits of the opening are kept at a tasteful minimum, signifying that this will not be one of the many sweet fruity floral fragrances that can be found almost everywhere. This fragrance takes its own path. The florals, too, are restrained and subtle, and they, along with the iris from the base form a wonderfully neutral accord that I don't know how to describe. It reminds me of the papyrus notes of some fragrances–or a premium bond paper or perhaps a dryer sheet that's very high-end, if you can imagine such a thing. This deluxe neutral note serves as a platform for displaying the richness and depth of the muted fruit in the top and the discreet woods and musk in the base. This carries the inventive transparent floral accord of L'Eau d'Issey one step further by further neutralizing individual notes in order to gain these beautifully compelling translucent combination accords. The whole neutral floral / paper thing is very successfully accomplished in Envy, because it results in a progression that is both elegant and casual at the same time. Sophistication and ease in one and the same traditionally structured progression. Possible synthetics aside, I believe Envy was ground breaking when it was introduced, and it has remained a wonderful and special feminine fragrance.Originally submitted 24 May 20073rd December 201079956jtdShow all reviewsWhy is this called Envy? Should it inspire envy? Symbolize envy? Should I value envy? Sounds much more like a Calvin Klein fragrance wanna-be name, but I bought it, so who's to say the marketing didn't work? No. 19 is a sharp green floral, PR Metal is a flinty green floral, Alliage is a cool green floral. Envy is a sour green floral. Bitter works wonderfully in perfume, hence all the great leathers and chypres. Sour is another story entirely. Sour, as in acidic, can add balance to food, but doesn't really have a comparable place in fragrance. It's sort of like coffee in that respect. Bitter coffee is an ideal, sour coffee is a shame. But the sourness here adds a bit of fruit that ties together the green and white florals and makes the whole thing soapy, if a bit cold. I wear it occasionally, and, interestingly, this is one of the few fragrances that people smell on me (a man) and comment positively on. I think sour reads to some people as a sibling tone to the popular fresh and sport. I come back to this one occasionally, but I've never really grown fond of it. It is an insecticide-like floral, with references to floral notes but not the feel of bloom to it. I think it is the soapiness that makes me not write it off, but I can't say it is an enjoyable fragrance.29th November 2010150715BetsyMeszarosShow all reviewsI can never decide about Envy. It is seductive. Something you want to resist but can't. It seems like a sophisticated worldly scent to me. It seems like something I can't get my head around. I don't know if I like it but I think I love it. Like some guy you use for sex but on the other hand like some guy you want to always be there and you can't resist even though you know he's bad. 26th September 2010150952RRBShow all reviewsI was put off Envy for a long time because I saw it as heavily commercial and ubiquitous... as others have written it was the sickeningly distinctive smell of glossy department stores in my late teens and early 20s. But I had always been surprised by how much I liked it - and when a friend offered me some half-used bottles (\"cats' piss\" she declared) I was keen. It's gorgeous... Cristalle overlaid with some ripe fruit (melon? apples?) and underlaid with sweet woods and musk. I've pondered the name - I think it works with the obvious association with green, but doesn't conjure the fragrance's warmer, sunnier, fat character. (The chiselled models faking the throes of passion in the ads don't really fit the smell either.) It also reminds me of another fruity chypre - Parfum de Nicolai's Vie de Chateau - which combines ripe fruit, hay, and greenery. I take the point of reviewers like Chandler Burr and Bois de Jasmin that Envy redefines what we think of 'florals' - the heady, edible warmth of hyacinth that is not at all sentimental weak pastels... 27th March 201075283Bushido MidoriShow all reviewsI apply Envy when i wear leather. Strong and willful scent,not really for everyone,cause it can outdo person wearing it. It has some of that new-age style when it comes to perfume designing,light( it doesnt summon clouds,sea and wind,but unique sense of confidence,that makes anything at ease in this world ) and full of attitude. Well executed and blended. Beautiful suillage,fair longevity. 7th January 201074867TortolaShow all reviewsI wore Envy a lot in my 20s and to me it is a sexy green tea scent (if such a thing is possible!). It oozes money and sophiscation and just doesn't smell like anything else, which is always a good thing as far as I'm concerned. I wouldn't wear it now but it's still great. Gotta love Maurice Roucel for this one. 12th December 200974393privateblendShow all reviewsEnvy started strong,Loud and high pitched.But I give it a minute or two to cool off and I was surprised.Envy turned out to be a smooth and cold scent. It smells like frosted metal, the kind that is cool and pleasent to touch but with an added sweetness to it. It can be considered aloof but underneath all the cool attitude there is a pleasant husky texture to the scent, only a bit, a throaty chuckle instead of a shrieking laughters.It is nothing short of a masterpiece. 25th November 200960305DiamondflameShow all reviewsThe brief to Maurice Roucel must have been very brief indeed, probably just that single word: ENVY. For Roucel seems to have had pretty much a free hand in this undertaking, opting for the easier no-brainer option to draw upon the oft-quoted phrase, 'green with envy'. And that's what we got here, folks - a green floral. But unlike the fresh effervescence of Tommy Girl's spring morning, Envy is more about spring evenings with dusk approaching, flowers in late bloom, a peach ripening on a stem, mayhap a touch synthetic but still lactonic. I find the musky and powdery heart addictive and kept sniffing myself every few minutes. But far from being a happy scent, Envy's dusky yet seductive demeanour hints at darker secrets, of desires and longings and quite possibly, envy. A wearable if somewhat seductive scent that comes across as 'young'. On a sultry beauty, I could even imagine Envy as the embodiment of a third-party aka the 'husband-stealer'. Now if that isn't something that elicits envy, I don't know what is. 12th November 200970027AshaShow all reviewsGucci EnvyNotes: Hyacinth, Magnolia, Lily of the Valley, Jasmine, Violet, Iris (from sephora.com)I have to be very honest. I do not smell anything like what is listed in the notes for Gucci Envy. When I first spray it, I smell something like waxed Granny Smith apples and plastic screechy florals. In the drydown I smell vestiges of the plastic top notes along with an extremely \"perfumey\" synthetic powder note and nondescript sweet musk. I can't say it is completely unpleasant, but here's what's really interesting about Envy...Envy smells like the fragrance counter at Macy's. In other words, it smells like a cloud of fragrance which is composed of countless spray-testing all the more recent fragrances available at a mid-level department store. This is the PURE ESSENCE OF MALL smell. I have to give some kudos for being able to bottle such a nebulous thing. It's definitely not for me, but I can understand the appeal. 30th October 200950092SporenburgShow all reviewsI bought this for my wife when it came out, mainly because I was curious what Gucci, in the middle of a creative rebirth, was doing in the area of fragrance. Well, they created a classic. Such a beautiful fragrance and one that for once deserves the description modern (most of the time a word mistaken with current fashion, and most new fragrances don't deserve to be called modern.) This truly is a stylish fragrance for women that, once and for all, ends the tradition of musty, female perfume. This is crisp, green, sharp but unmistakably female. Undeniably great (too bad the male version wasn't any good.) 16th May 20096689812 Next Most reviews in the last weekColbourne (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (4)landshark321 (3)exmin (3)speedracer (3)RoamingRose (3)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)epapsiou (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (28)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)Varanis Ridari (8)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Lian (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

So I shoved it to the back of my perfume collection and haven't touched it for a couple of years. I hauled it out yesterday and dusted it off. It's still pretty, but it's very white-flowery on me  I don't get any pineapple or rose or sandalwood or pretty much any of the other notes. And I think I've figured out why it irritated me  a) the white flowers take over after half an hour or so, b) it barely lasted four hours and c) what was left took on a rather sharp, almost-but-not-quite sour green edge. I'm going to try layering it with something else to see what happens, as the first half hour of this is rather lovely. If anybody has any suggestions, I'd be happy to try them. 25th September 2016177259JackTwistShow all reviewsThis is a nice sweet green floral that to my nose combines an apple note with a muguet note, though oddly apple is not listed as an ingredient.Barbara Herman finds this a tart green rose with a powdery anise dry down. My nose does not relate to any of those impressions. On me it is a pleasant green fruity floral, no better or worse than any of the dozens of other perfumes I have experienced in that category. It is definitely a young smell - I can see it working perfectly on a young, vibrant woman in her twenties.Herman also comes up with lots more notes than on this Basenotes page: galbanum, coriander, anise, celery, violet leaf, rose, cumin.Turin describes it simply as a \"green floral\" but gives it 5 stars.

Sell some plasma, buy a bottle, take it to a bespoke perfumer, make them copy it for you, strike fear in the hearts of men, reign supreme. I rue the day Gucci discontinued this. 6th April 2021241104Brian BuchananShow all reviewsA sour green floral of three parts : a bitter brown base, a green accord and a sour floral. The floral is a magnolia bouquet, made sour by sharp lilac, fugitive hyacinth and fake citrus. There's also cold iris and a green accord based on shiny muguet leaf. But Envy is not just sour and green, it's one of the driest florals around. There's a bitter black note in the magnolia petal - which adds a gritty edge - and this is worked into a kind of burnt-sugar mossy base, which is anything but sweet. In fact, what sweetness there is, is only there to stop the tamarisk note from getting out of hand, nothing more. But, even though it's bold and striking, Envy's not as original as it seems. It's like green l'Eau d'issey, which is set on a base of scorched earth that clearly derives from Sinan. On the other hand, what is different about Envy is - it doesn't try to smell nice. By flouting the idea that it 'should always smell good' Envy places itself firmly in the difficult - or Expressionist camp - along with some of Roudnitska's work, Sécrétions, Poison etc. And of course it was a big success, which goes to show that a safe perfume isn't always the most lucrative one. Back in 1997, it seems the public had an unhealthy appetite for 'mean and nasty' as well as pink fluff and candyfloss, and we see the same thing happening today with the Spiky Woods. The smell may be different - but the spirit is the same; just the materials have changed - for the worse.Aggressive and mean, Envy was a success - because of its faults - and not despite them. And they are what make it so distinctive and memorable. ***** 16th October 2019266799ADVERTISEMENTramin1215Show all reviewsCostume design for the ballet \"Mad Tristan\" by Salvador Dali 3rd May 2018201042scenttasticShow all reviewsI was given a big bottle of this for Christmas several years ago, and initially I really liked it, but after a while, for some reason, it started to irritate me.

This throwback to the 70s, that Tom Ford does so well, should be evident from the first glimpse of his spare, chrome-capped bottle. The big floral notes--Hyacinth and Muguet--could easily take the bit between their teeth and make a run for it, but in Roucel's hands they are so well blended and harmonious that they are real team players. Does it smell a bit like expensive shampoo? Absolutely. Imagine a woman who has just stepped out of the shower at a first class hotel, say, the George V. In 1979. She wraps herself in a luxurious white robe while she ponders what to wear that night (does she wear the Castelbajac or the Sonia Rykiel? Her Maud Frizon snakeskin sandals or the gold leather Charles Jourdan pumps?). Before the makeup, before she lights her first cigarette of the evening, before she pours herself a Dubonnet and before she douses herself with Calandre, she smells like this--fresh, floral, clean..... 23rd January 2016167235Shifty BatShow all reviewsI like Envy. I like it because it is unambitious yet different from the modern climes. It is an almost entirely floral composition, in a throwback way which somehow casts an unassailable aura around the wearer, like a vampiric woman whose creation and heart are rooted in the 40's, and who walks the Earth unchanged, unmoved. I also like that it is like an echo, growing smaller and more distant, as hour by hour the bittersweet petals are stripped away, layer after layer, until all that is left is a cool and pleasant iris, like the core of an old Guerlain. 30th December 2015166182JackTwistShow all reviewsThis is a nice sweet green floral that to my nose combines an apple note with a muguet note, though oddly apple is not listed as an ingredient.Barbara Herman finds this a tart green rose with a powdery anise dry down.

It's quick to fill a room, but the essential bitterness of its green notes keeps it from becoming crude or cloying. In other words, it's a fine example of Maurice Roucel in his expansive mood  the same one in which he composed Insolence and Musc Ravageur. Envy's floral notes include bold jasmine and orange blossom which bear a hefty load of fleshy indoles. These give Envy a decadent, lascivious undertone that balances out it's clean, green attributes. The tension between Envy's green and animalic faces makes wearing it an enthralling experience. I find myself waiting expectantly for one of the two sides to take over and throw the balance, but the suspense does not subside until the entire composition retreats into its relatively simple, pastel green, coumarin-tinged drydown. An altogether pleasant scent, and one I'm comfortable wearing (in small doses) as a man.13th June 2014141714GrottolaShow all reviewsProbably the greatest green floral ever made, except for maybe Chamade by Guerlain. This one isn't harsh at all, and it's not too powdery or heavy on galbanum like many of its ilk. It's simply a smooth, grassy-green lily fragrance that pumps out decent enough longevity and still smells pretty natural. While Envy is a pretty \"safe\" fragrance, it doesn't really need to be obtrusive or make a huge statement. It takes some talent to be able to create a green floral so pleasant yet natural and soft-spoken. If you can find it, then get it, at least for reference. Even if you're a dude. 25th September 2012117162emelleShow all reviewsmy perfume choices are different from my mother.but this one is the one we love both. it is soft floral clean and refreshing. it smells like wind on spring. smells so young and tender. 3rd July 2012113087alfaromShow all reviewsHenry Matisse used to say: \"Don't try to be original. Be simple. Be good technically, and if there is something in you, it will come out\". Envy is a simple masterpiece. It opens with a sour, sort of unripe, pear/apple accord that is quickly joined by bitter green notes, jasmine and other florals. For a few moments it immediately reminded me of Chanel No.19 but where the Chanel strikes as incredibly serious, the Gucci introduces a light-hearted vibe that gives this composition more versatility. At the same time Roucel is is able to avoid the youthful allure of many compositions of the same genre by balancing the overall freshness with an indolic element that adds a solid consitency to the whole composition. Overall Envy is potent, long lasting and distinctive...Just perfect. Does great also on a man.11th November 2011100433Oh_HedgehogShow all reviewsSerge Lutens saw fit to flatter Gucci's Envy with his L'Eau Serge Lutens (2010), yet despite this and what appears to be widespread veneration, Maurice Roucel's commission for Gucci feels to me like a cheapened synthetic variant of the terrific green floral austerity of Chanel's No.19 (1971).

The fruits balance themselves out nicely along with the magnolia and freesia. Thankfully pineapple is a subtle note here, because with most perfumes pineapple likes to rear its ugly head and cause me to dislike a scent.As the fragrance settles on the skin it becomes increasingly grassy, but not sharp like Chanel No.19. Envy is tame and polite, it doesn't like to make a loud, obtrusive statement. Envy feels very modern for its time. Its slight metallic-like quality captivates me. Although Envy is something that I probably wouldn't wear, I am very intrigued by it. Envy fascinated me from the very beginning to the very end.The lasting strength is average, if not a little better than average. Like I mentioned before this isn't a particularly strong scent, so I'd say it is fairly intimate. A green floral that I do surprisingly recommend.26th June 201193368asilverfire614Show all reviewsI tested this the other day and didn't expect to lie it at all. I've never been a huge fan of Gucci fragrances, and I've never been a huge fan of floral greens in general. They almost always smell unpleasant to me. That being said, I LOVE IT! The opening was as green as it could be without burning my nose hairs, and I actually liked it. I don't know what makes this one different, but it made me feel very confident...bold...in a no-nonsense kind of way. It was sharp and bitter but incredibly sexy and feminine at the same time. The floral dry-down was very pleasant as well and it lasted all day on me. I see this as being a great summer fragrance to add to my collection!Jan032009 27th March 201188126Nile_EtlandShow all reviewsThis is another one of those fragrances that seems to be different every time I wear it. Is it the weather or just the mood I'm in? I can't say. I don't think this will ever be my No.1 can't-live-without-it fragrance but I like it a lot and was delighted to pick up a bottle at TK Max. It starts off fresh and light, then after a few moments a deeper powdery note comes through and the two seem to oscillate - some days the freshness and fruit seem to predominate, sometimes the powdery note. I don't know whether this is a typical Gucci fragrance, it's the only Gucci I've got so I've got nothing to compare it to, but for me it makes that 'fresh out of the shower' feeling last all day. It's a fresh daytime scent, unlikely to offend anyone sitting near you at the theatre or dining at the next table. For evening I prefer something a bit richer and more feminine but I'm very happy with my bargain buy for daytime wear and (if I come across another cheap, whether at TK Max or on the Net) I may indulge myself again.27th February 201186033odysseusmShow all reviewsA lovely, pretty scent.

This deluxe neutral note serves as a platform for displaying the richness and depth of the muted fruit in the top and the discreet woods and musk in the base. This carries the inventive transparent floral accord of L'Eau d'Issey one step further by further neutralizing individual notes in order to gain these beautifully compelling translucent combination accords. The whole neutral floral / paper thing is very successfully accomplished in Envy, because it results in a progression that is both elegant and casual at the same time. Sophistication and ease in one and the same traditionally structured progression. Possible synthetics aside, I believe Envy was ground breaking when it was introduced, and it has remained a wonderful and special feminine fragrance.Originally submitted 24 May 20073rd December 201079956jtdShow all reviewsWhy is this called Envy? Should it inspire envy? Symbolize envy? Should I value envy? Sounds much more like a Calvin Klein fragrance wanna-be name, but I bought it, so who's to say the marketing didn't work? No. 19 is a sharp green floral, PR Metal is a flinty green floral, Alliage is a cool green floral. Envy is a sour green floral. Bitter works wonderfully in perfume, hence all the great leathers and chypres. Sour is another story entirely. Sour, as in acidic, can add balance to food, but doesn't really have a comparable place in fragrance. It's sort of like coffee in that respect. Bitter coffee is an ideal, sour coffee is a shame. But the sourness here adds a bit of fruit that ties together the green and white florals and makes the whole thing soapy, if a bit cold. I wear it occasionally, and, interestingly, this is one of the few fragrances that people smell on me (a man) and comment positively on. I think sour reads to some people as a sibling tone to the popular fresh and sport. I come back to this one occasionally, but I've never really grown fond of it. It is an insecticide-like floral, with references to floral notes but not the feel of bloom to it. I think it is the soapiness that makes me not write it off, but I can't say it is an enjoyable fragrance.29th November 2010150715BetsyMeszarosShow all reviewsI can never decide about Envy. It is seductive. Something you want to resist but can't. It seems like a sophisticated worldly scent to me. It seems like something I can't get my head around. I don't know if I like it but I think I love it. Like some guy you use for sex but on the other hand like some guy you want to always be there and you can't resist even though you know he's bad. 26th September 2010150952pabloShow all reviewsgood fragance..couldnt use it myself ..too femenine..reminds me of a more trashypolo sport woman... 2nd April 201045363RRBShow all reviewsI was put off Envy for a long time because I saw it as heavily commercial and ubiquitous... as others have written it was the sickeningly distinctive smell of glossy department stores in my late teens and early 20s. But I had always been surprised by how much I liked it - and when a friend offered me some half-used bottles (\"cats' piss\" she declared) I was keen. It's gorgeous... Cristalle overlaid with some ripe fruit (melon? apples?) and underlaid with sweet woods and musk. I've pondered the name - I think it works with the obvious association with green, but doesn't conjure the fragrance's warmer, sunnier, fat character. (The chiselled models faking the throes of passion in the ads don't really fit the smell either.) It also reminds me of another fruity chypre - Parfum de Nicolai's Vie de Chateau - which combines ripe fruit, hay, and greenery. I take the point of reviewers like Chandler Burr and Bois de Jasmin that Envy redefines what we think of 'florals' - the heady, edible warmth of hyacinth that is not at all sentimental weak pastels... 27th March 201075283Bushido MidoriShow all reviewsI apply Envy when i wear leather. Strong and willful scent,not really for everyone,cause it can outdo person wearing it. It has some of that new-age style when it comes to perfume designing,light( it doesnt summon clouds,sea and wind,but unique sense of confidence,that makes anything at ease in this world ) and full of attitude. Well executed and blended. Beautiful suillage,fair longevity. 7th January 201074867TortolaShow all reviewsI wore Envy a lot in my 20s and to me it is a sexy green tea scent (if such a thing is possible!). It oozes money and sophiscation and just doesn't smell like anything else, which is always a good thing as far as I'm concerned. I wouldn't wear it now but it's still great. Gotta love Maurice Roucel for this one. 12th December 20097439312 Next Most reviews in the last weekmanlyscents (8)Colbourne (8)Varanis Ridari (4)landshark321 (3)exmin (3)speedracer (3)RoamingRose (3)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)sakecat (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (28)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (8)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Lian (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

It doesn't evoke a dirty beach or a seaweed-filled coast. Instead, the citrusy and mineral notes prevent it from being too oceanic, creating a crisp and clean coastal breeze vibe. While this may be one of the best from the Jo Malone line, its weak performance makes it hard to justify a full bottle. Given its type, low performance is expected. It lacks the spices of Epice Marine, the ambery woody bases of designer blue scents, or the heavy dose of calone found in some aquatics. While unisex, it may lean a bit feminine due to the softness added by the sage. Marine fragrances are hard to assign a gender to, but the sage does give it a feminine leaning. Overall, this scent is nothing groundbreaking, but it is still a lovely and relaxing scent that is worth trying if you visit your local Sephora. 7th April 2022272605Ed WardianShow all reviewsJo Malone's Wood Sage and Sea Salt Cologne captures the spirited crisp of a north English coastline and its body of minerals, driftwood and saltwater wisps; creating a scent story as soothing as its inspiration. This is a fragrance that is essentially pink and gray in essence like the natural colour of sea salt and bedrock it beautifully emulates; emanating cool whiffs of briny air, sulfuric moisture of red algae, camphorous woods and stony edges... Truly, an imagining that note-wise may suggest a green aquatic but delightfully far and wide from that sort. It can be collectively likened to a creamy and cool spa treatment, raised by its minor hints of buchu leaf, rounded plum, dried fruit, giving the greater sum of its parts, sage, seawood, grapefruit, and ambrette a full radiance that is ethereal, peachy clean and ozonic. The sage, in particular, with its mentholated drift carries an uplifting weight to the saline heart, offering a natural earthy depth to the accord. Surely, this is an ambient signature for warmer climate that fares well for a cologne with its soft sillage and longevity, especially on clothing. Simply, a gender bender that is intimate as hovering thoughts among gray pebbles, damp sand, driftwood, herbal shrubs, sea mists, cool air of a northern sea... Riveting! 17th June 2021244366ADVERTISEMENTspeedracerShow all reviewsThumbs up for the scent alone but the performance is not great.Really nice grapefruit opening that quickly evolves into a slightly sweet, citrus-floral-woody scent with a minor tea note. Very calm and pleasant.I always thought of this as a feminine scent but wearing it more, it feels unisex to me.Very light projection and doesn't last long, maybe 4-5 hours. 11th November 2020235773rbakerShow all reviewsThe restrained wood and the dominating sea salt hit me straight from the beginning. A marine opening due to a fresh ambrette-base crispness, as if and old wooden boat is drying out in the beach. And added green herbal undertone - sage with whiffs of leaves - mixes with the aroma of sea weed. Added freshness is provided by an overarching grapefruit impression with the occasional whiff of lemon, especially at the beginning. I get moderate sillage, good projection and four hours of longevity on my skin. A nice and summery marine scent that is crafted well. Unlike some other creations of this house that often designs its fragrances for layering, this one is nicely wearable on its own. 3/5. 6th November 2019222952DebbieHoviousShow all reviewsSubtle but has staying power. Jo Malone doesn't disappoint. I like it! 26th November 2018209727Kaizen1972Show all reviewsA really wonderful, distinct formulation from Jo Malone. Wood Sage & Sea Salt is ultimately an aromatic, musky, citrus and marine fragrance that is light and wearable esp. in warmer weather.Notes in WS&SS include Ambrette (musk mallow), Sea Salt, Sage, Seaweed (red algae), and Grapefruit. The result is a truly beach oriented portrait that elicits feelings of adventure and enjoyment of nature in me!It's an aquatic creation for sure. Pure genius mixing sea salt and the mildly peppery sage spice in the form of a fragrance! The musk mallow adds an earthy, musky touch, and the seaweed along with the grapefruit evoke marine waters in my mind.Leaning more towards masculine wear, WS&SS - according to the company - can be mixed with their Lime Basil & Mandarin, or Nectarine Blossom & Honey, fragrances.Give it a try! 10th October 2018207946lisaehansonShow all reviewsI really love this one! Soft, subtle, and very unique. 18th August 2018205587FunwithfragsShow all reviewsI find much of the Jo Malone line to be superfluous. The tea scents are good, but I find it difficult to believe that when your range is this large that there can be consistent quality. This is good, very well-conceived, a nice combination of fresh woody notes and outdorrsy condiments. Sea Breeze through a nearby wood. Performance, though, tends to the abysmal. 8th August 2018205167HaylingShow all reviewsBig thumbs up for the smell. Thumbs down for the lackluster performance... But the smell is really really pleasant. It reminds me of Pacific Rock Moss in a way :) 3rd July 2018203662Scent DetectiveShow all reviewsBig thumbs-up from me for Wood, Sage & Sea Salt from Jo Malone. Very nice fragrance. Smells classy and is, as mentioned, very light and non offensive to those around you, but it puts off such a pleasant woody, slightly salty, herbal fragrance that I just love it. I don't typically like the salty fragrances when they're combined with sweet, fruity accords, so this was a welcome salty experience. I would like a little better longevity and sillage, but it still lasted about four and a half hours on me before I couldn't detect it anymore without difficulty. I'd love to have a bottle of this in my collection. An extremely nice summer scent. 7th July 2016174123MFfan310Show all reviewsGot a mini as a welcome gift.It's light and inoffensive - but that's the Jo Malone brand in general. As a rule, one should not expect beastmode fragrances from this house. And true to its name, it's a woody salty fragrance that's a unique composition. Not fruity, not citrus, not an aquatic - and it really shines in high heat. Worth a sniff if you want a different kind of high-heat fragrance. 12th June 2016173073NettyYetiShow all reviewsI had tempered my expectations based on previous reviews. This has exceeded expectations by more than a little. Sprayed on my wrist, the longevity is fleeting, but on my chest, I catch pleasant glimpses of this throughout the day. Silage is still less than your average fragrance, but I wouldn't wear this to impress. If price were not a barrier, I'd wear this to uplift. It's intimate, and I find that desirable. A nice choice for the office on a cloudy spring day (today was 50 and overcast in my neck of the woods). Mostly I pick up the salty/herbal vibe of this fragrance. Because there's not a strong fruity or citrus note, this feels less \"fun in the sun\" and more mature to my amateur nose. I'm late 20s, for reference. Overall execution is spot-on. My only complaint is price, but this isn't a fragrance made for the masses. In that sense, the exclusiveness that might come with this is part of the overall pleasure of wearing it. Only a certain type of man will wear this. I don't think I'm quite that man yet, but it's a man I would strive to become. 20th April 2016170850PerseveroShow all reviewsBought this after being pounced on by Jo Malone representative at Stansted Airport.

Never liked them enough to pull the trigger on a full bottle. Got this one as a gift, and i must say its better than most i have tried. Id say this along with lime and basil are probably the best of the lot. But even then there is a generic almost designer quality to it. The ingredients dont seem at par with other niche offerings in its price bracket. I dont really get any woodsiness, but a rather sweet salty aquatic inoffensive but unextraodinary perfume that can get cloying if overapplied. But like another review earlier mentioned its also quite fleeting if underapplied. Like with a lot of her newer offerings in the hermes lineup, christine nagel plays it safe, almost too safe! 12th October 2019222112clamnoleShow all reviewsWood Sage & Sea Salt is a pleasant scent from Jo Malone that should really be thought of as a layering base for one of their other fruity or spice fragrances. What you read is what you get. It has a soft wood (cedar perhaps?) and a light, breezy salt accord. On it's own it dissipates too quickly, but paired with another JM fragrance it creates olfactory heaven. My personal favorite is to layer it with Blackberry & Bay, or Earl Grey & Cucumber. Oddly amazing that it works, pairs itself divinely.I have to give it a Neutral on it's own, but a Thumbs Up as a layering base. 13th October 2017192722ADVERTISEMENTsjg3839Show all reviewsClean woody scent that won't offend anyone. Pretty safe, but nothing groundbreaking about it. I do like it, but for the price I wouldn't buy it. 7/10 11th December 2015165405OviattShow all reviewsThe notes sounded so great that, even though I have not been impressed by Jo Malone fragrances in the past, I was excited to try this. However, I found--not the walk along the English seaside, as the marketing promised--but an artificial bayberry note that brings to mind the candles sold in Hallmark stores around the holidays. Salted bayberries, to be sure, but berries none the less. Sage--sucha a great note when used well--was absent and even wood, the most used note in perfumery to date, was nowhere to be found. Pleasant, air freshener sort of scent. 1st July 2015158888rogalalShow all reviewsTo me, Wood Sage & Sea Salt smells mostly like ionones, those chemicals that smell like violets over suede. There's quite a bit of pink pepper as well, which serves mainly as a familiar touchstone because it's in so many fruity florals, so it keeps this from every smelling too \"weird\" or \"niche\". Beyond this perfumey suede-ish mixture, I can just barely perceive whiffs of plywood and cherry, and there's a buttery tone to everything as well.I can't smell any sage or sea salt to save my life, and think this may have been more accurate if it had been called \"Cherry Musk\" or \"Violets & Suede\", but it's OK for what it is. It's not particularly compelling, but it's been years since Jo Malone has released anything truly compelling, so it's just par for the course at this point. It's essentially a Cuir de Russie, but with all the grit and shine polished off and replaced with a sense of familiarity, though it very much doesn't smell like a dumbed-down mall perfume either. It's not bad, but I'm just not quite ready to give this a thumbs up either... 28th May 2015157207landshark321Show all reviewsThis is the first cologne by Ja Malone that I've worn (I tried a cologne intense, Velvet Rose & Oud), and the projection and overall strength of Wood Sage & Sea Salt are already noticeably different within an hour of spraying---so limited, in fact, that I'm reasonably sure it will be gone within a few hours, though I'll update if I'm wrong.It's a pleasant summer scent, with, apart from its named ingredients, musk and something sweet, perhaps citrus. And perhaps its lightness means that it will perform better in the summer, as I'm testing it out in the winter, though I feel the winter test is a better baseline for performance. It is a very agreeable scent, not likely to offend, but not particularly daring as an aquatic or woody scent. Nonetheless I could certainly see this being a summer staple for either gender because it is unoffensive, and a harmonious mix of salt, wood, and hits of spiciness and sweetness. It leans slightly toward Tom Ford's Costa Azzurra on scent, but of course not strength.If the strength weren't such an issue, I might have higher regard for this fragrance, but even though named a cologne, it is still too weak to consider buying, especially at its price points (30ml for $60, 100ml for $120). The cologne intense I tried at least seemed to offer some bang for some bucks.6 out of 10 5th February 2015151509Most reviews in the last weekmanlyscents (8)Colbourne (8)Varanis Ridari (4)exmin (3)landshark321 (3)RoamingRose (3)speedracer (3)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)SPACEDOUT (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (27)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (8)Lian (7)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

It doesn't evoke a dirty beach or a seaweed-filled coast. Instead, the citrusy and mineral notes prevent it from being too oceanic, creating a crisp and clean coastal breeze vibe. While this may be one of the best from the Jo Malone line, its weak performance makes it hard to justify a full bottle. Given its type, low performance is expected. It lacks the spices of Epice Marine, the ambery woody bases of designer blue scents, or the heavy dose of calone found in some aquatics. While unisex, it may lean a bit feminine due to the softness added by the sage. Marine fragrances are hard to assign a gender to, but the sage does give it a feminine leaning. Overall, this scent is nothing groundbreaking, but it is still a lovely and relaxing scent that is worth trying if you visit your local Sephora. 7th April 2022272605Ed WardianShow all reviewsJo Malone's Wood Sage and Sea Salt Cologne captures the spirited crisp of a north English coastline and its body of minerals, driftwood and saltwater wisps; creating a scent story as soothing as its inspiration. This is a fragrance that is essentially pink and gray in essence like the natural colour of sea salt and bedrock it beautifully emulates; emanating cool whiffs of briny air, sulfuric moisture of red algae, camphorous woods and stony edges... Truly, an imagining that note-wise may suggest a green aquatic but delightfully far and wide from that sort. It can be collectively likened to a creamy and cool spa treatment, raised by its minor hints of buchu leaf, rounded plum, dried fruit, giving the greater sum of its parts, sage, seawood, grapefruit, and ambrette a full radiance that is ethereal, peachy clean and ozonic. The sage, in particular, with its mentholated drift carries an uplifting weight to the saline heart, offering a natural earthy depth to the accord. Surely, this is an ambient signature for warmer climate that fares well for a cologne with its soft sillage and longevity, especially on clothing. Simply, a gender bender that is intimate as hovering thoughts among gray pebbles, damp sand, driftwood, herbal shrubs, sea mists, cool air of a northern sea... Riveting! 17th June 2021244366ADVERTISEMENTspeedracerShow all reviewsThumbs up for the scent alone but the performance is not great.Really nice grapefruit opening that quickly evolves into a slightly sweet, citrus-floral-woody scent with a minor tea note. Very calm and pleasant.I always thought of this as a feminine scent but wearing it more, it feels unisex to me.Very light projection and doesn't last long, maybe 4-5 hours. 11th November 2020235773rbakerShow all reviewsThe restrained wood and the dominating sea salt hit me straight from the beginning. A marine opening due to a fresh ambrette-base crispness, as if and old wooden boat is drying out in the beach. And added green herbal undertone - sage with whiffs of leaves - mixes with the aroma of sea weed. Added freshness is provided by an overarching grapefruit impression with the occasional whiff of lemon, especially at the beginning. I get moderate sillage, good projection and four hours of longevity on my skin. A nice and summery marine scent that is crafted well. Unlike some other creations of this house that often designs its fragrances for layering, this one is nicely wearable on its own. 3/5. 6th November 2019222952DebbieHoviousShow all reviewsSubtle but has staying power. Jo Malone doesn't disappoint. I like it! 26th November 2018209727Kaizen1972Show all reviewsA really wonderful, distinct formulation from Jo Malone. Wood Sage & Sea Salt is ultimately an aromatic, musky, citrus and marine fragrance that is light and wearable esp. in warmer weather.Notes in WS&SS include Ambrette (musk mallow), Sea Salt, Sage, Seaweed (red algae), and Grapefruit. The result is a truly beach oriented portrait that elicits feelings of adventure and enjoyment of nature in me!It's an aquatic creation for sure. Pure genius mixing sea salt and the mildly peppery sage spice in the form of a fragrance! The musk mallow adds an earthy, musky touch, and the seaweed along with the grapefruit evoke marine waters in my mind.Leaning more towards masculine wear, WS&SS - according to the company - can be mixed with their Lime Basil & Mandarin, or Nectarine Blossom & Honey, fragrances.Give it a try! 10th October 2018207946lisaehansonShow all reviewsI really love this one! Soft, subtle, and very unique. 18th August 2018205587FunwithfragsShow all reviewsI find much of the Jo Malone line to be superfluous. The tea scents are good, but I find it difficult to believe that when your range is this large that there can be consistent quality. This is good, very well-conceived, a nice combination of fresh woody notes and outdorrsy condiments. Sea Breeze through a nearby wood. Performance, though, tends to the abysmal. 8th August 2018205167HaylingShow all reviewsBig thumbs up for the smell. Thumbs down for the lackluster performance...

For a long time, the scent develops an odd, buttery smell. Sort of like movie popcorn with the \"butter\" topping. I don't care for it.The base is really blah. A vague, soapy-detergent smell. 4th May 2015155799Most reviews in the last weekmanlyscents (8)Colbourne (8)Varanis Ridari (4)exmin (3)landshark321 (3)RoamingRose (3)speedracer (3)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)SPACEDOUT (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (27)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (8)Lian (7)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

        "Name": "Reviews of Wood Sage & Sea Salt by Jo Malone London",
        "All reviews": "Show all reviewsThis is a fresh floral marine scent with a touch of saltiness. It doesn't evoke a dirty beach or a seaweed-filled coast. Instead, the citrusy and mineral notes prevent it from being too oceanic, creating a crisp and clean coastal breeze vibe. While this may be one of the best from the Jo Malone line, its weak performance makes it hard to justify a full bottle. Given its type, low performance is expected. It lacks the spices of Epice Marine, the ambery woody bases of designer blue scents, or the heavy dose of calone found in some aquatics. While unisex, it may lean a bit feminine due to the softness added by the sage. Marine fragrances are hard to assign a gender to, but the sage does give it a feminine leaning. Overall, this scent is nothing groundbreaking, but it is still a lovely and relaxing scent that is worth trying if you visit your local Sephora. 7th April 2022272605Ed WardianShow all reviewsJo Malone's Wood Sage and Sea Salt Cologne captures the spirited crisp of a north English coastline and its body of minerals, driftwood and saltwater wisps; creating a scent story as soothing as its inspiration. This is a fragrance that is essentially pink and gray in essence like the natural colour of sea salt and bedrock it beautifully emulates; emanating cool whiffs of briny air, sulfuric moisture of red algae, camphorous woods and stony edges... Truly, an imagining that note-wise may suggest a green aquatic but delightfully far and wide from that sort. It can be collectively likened to a creamy and cool spa treatment, raised by its minor hints of buchu leaf, rounded plum, dried fruit, giving the greater sum of its parts, sage, seawood, grapefruit, and ambrette a full radiance that is ethereal, peachy clean and ozonic. The sage, in particular, with its mentholated drift carries an uplifting weight to the saline heart, offering a natural earthy depth to the accord. Surely, this is an ambient signature for warmer climate that fares well for a cologne with its soft sillage and longevity, especially on clothing. Simply, a gender bender that is intimate as hovering thoughts among gray pebbles, damp sand, driftwood, herbal shrubs, sea mists, cool air of a northern sea... Riveting! 17th June 2021244366ADVERTISEMENTspeedracerShow all reviewsThumbs up for the scent alone but the performance is not great.Really nice grapefruit opening that quickly evolves into a slightly sweet, citrus-floral-woody scent with a minor tea note. Very calm and pleasant.I always thought of this as a feminine scent but wearing it more, it feels unisex to me.Very light projection and doesn't last long, maybe 4-5 hours. 11th November 2020235773rbakerShow all reviewsThe restrained wood and the dominating sea salt hit me straight from the beginning. A marine opening due to a fresh ambrette-base crispness, as if and old wooden boat is drying out in the beach. And added green herbal undertone - sage with whiffs of leaves - mixes with the aroma of sea weed. Added freshness is provided by an overarching grapefruit impression with the occasional whiff of lemon, especially at the beginning. I get moderate sillage, good projection and four hours of longevity on my skin. A nice and summery marine scent that is crafted well. Unlike some other creations of this house that often designs its fragrances for layering, this one is nicely wearable on its own. 3/5. 6th November 2019222952satyenShow all reviewsI have sampled a lot of jo malone. Never liked them enough to pull the trigger on a full bottle. Got this one as a gift, and i must say its better than most i have tried. Id say this along with lime and basil are probably the best of the lot. But even then there is a generic almost designer quality to it. The ingredients dont seem at par with other niche offerings in its price bracket. I dont really get any woodsiness, but a rather sweet salty aquatic inoffensive but unextraodinary perfume that can get cloying if overapplied. But like another review earlier mentioned its also quite fleeting if underapplied. Like with a lot of her newer offerings in the hermes lineup, christine nagel plays it safe, almost too safe! 12th October 2019222112Xaterian StormrageShow all reviewsBright citrus (lemon I'm guessing, and grapefruit) opening, aquatic and extremely light. Very, very light: as in, dries down to a skin scent in 15 minutes light. As in, disappears from your skin completely in an hour or two light. I get sea salt, yes: and slight florals such as the sage and possibly lavender. Almost no wood, however: if it's there it is gone as quickly as it started.Completely forgettable, performance is absolutely terrible: unforgivably bad. Maybe the worst I've had yet in a fragrance. Hard to even make a complete evaluation when I have scent that dissipates so quickly. What more can I say?2/103rd April 2019215030DebbieHoviousShow all reviewsSubtle but has staying power. Jo Malone doesn't disappoint. I like it! 26th November 2018209727Kaizen1972Show all reviewsA really wonderful, distinct formulation from Jo Malone. Wood Sage & Sea Salt is ultimately an aromatic, musky, citrus and marine fragrance that is light and wearable esp. in warmer weather.Notes in WS&SS include Ambrette (musk mallow), Sea Salt, Sage, Seaweed (red algae), and Grapefruit. The result is a truly beach oriented portrait that elicits feelings of adventure and enjoyment of nature in me!It's an aquatic creation for sure. Pure genius mixing sea salt and the mildly peppery sage spice in the form of a fragrance! The musk mallow adds an earthy, musky touch, and the seaweed along with the grapefruit evoke marine waters in my mind.Leaning more towards masculine wear, WS&SS - according to the company - can be mixed with their Lime Basil & Mandarin, or Nectarine Blossom & Honey, fragrances.Give it a try! 10th October 2018207946lisaehansonShow all reviewsI really love this one! Soft, subtle, and very unique. 18th August 2018205587FunwithfragsShow all reviewsI find much of the Jo Malone line to be superfluous. The tea scents are good, but I find it difficult to believe that when your range is this large that there can be consistent quality. This is good, very well-conceived, a nice combination of fresh woody notes and outdorrsy condiments. Sea Breeze through a nearby wood. Performance, though, tends to the abysmal. 8th August 2018205167HaylingShow all reviewsBig thumbs up for the smell. Thumbs down for the lackluster performance... But the smell is really really pleasant. It reminds me of Pacific Rock Moss in a way :) 3rd July 2018203662clamnoleShow all reviewsWood Sage & Sea Salt is a pleasant scent from Jo Malone that should really be thought of as a layering base for one of their other fruity or spice fragrances. What you read is what you get. It has a soft wood (cedar perhaps?) and a light, breezy salt accord. On it's own it dissipates too quickly, but paired with another JM fragrance it creates olfactory heaven. My personal favorite is to layer it with Blackberry & Bay, or Earl Grey & Cucumber. Oddly amazing that it works, pairs itself divinely.I have to give it a Neutral on it's own, but a Thumbs Up as a layering base. 13th October 2017192722Scent DetectiveShow all reviewsBig thumbs-up from me for Wood, Sage & Sea Salt from Jo Malone. Very nice fragrance. Smells classy and is, as mentioned, very light and non offensive to those around you, but it puts off such a pleasant woody, slightly salty, herbal fragrance that I just love it. I don't typically like the salty fragrances when they're combined with sweet, fruity accords, so this was a welcome salty experience. I would like a little better longevity and sillage, but it still lasted about four and a half hours on me before I couldn't detect it anymore without difficulty. I'd love to have a bottle of this in my collection. An extremely nice summer scent. 7th July 2016174123MFfan310Show all reviewsGot a mini as a welcome gift.It's light and inoffensive - but that's the Jo Malone brand in general. As a rule, one should not expect beastmode fragrances from this house. And true to its name, it's a woody salty fragrance that's a unique composition. Not fruity, not citrus, not an aquatic - and it really shines in high heat. Worth a sniff if you want a different kind of high-heat fragrance. 12th June 2016173073NettyYetiShow all reviewsI had tempered my expectations based on previous reviews. This has exceeded expectations by more than a little. Sprayed on my wrist, the longevity is fleeting, but on my chest, I catch pleasant glimpses of this throughout the day. Silage is still less than your average fragrance, but I wouldn't wear this to impress. If price were not a barrier, I'd wear this to uplift. It's intimate, and I find that desirable. A nice choice for the office on a cloudy spring day (today was 50 and overcast in my neck of the woods). Mostly I pick up the salty/herbal vibe of this fragrance. Because there's not a strong fruity or citrus note, this feels less \"fun in the sun\" and more mature to my amateur nose. I'm late 20s, for reference. Overall execution is spot-on. My only complaint is price, but this isn't a fragrance made for the masses. In that sense, the exclusiveness that might come with this is part of the overall pleasure of wearing it. Only a certain type of man will wear this. I don't think I'm quite that man yet, but it's a man I would strive to become. 20th April 2016170850sjg3839Show all reviewsClean woody scent that won't offend anyone. Pretty safe, but nothing groundbreaking about it. I do like it, but for the price I wouldn't buy it. 7/10 11th December 2015165405epapsiouShow all reviewsInsipid. Smells like pantene shampoo (which is not bad but not worth $100) I did not smell sage or sea salt. Save your money. 18th October 2015163085OviattShow all reviewsThe notes sounded so great that, even though I have not been impressed by Jo Malone fragrances in the past, I was excited to try this. However, I found--not the walk along the English seaside, as the marketing promised--but an artificial bayberry note that brings to mind the candles sold in Hallmark stores around the holidays. Salted bayberries, to be sure, but berries none the less. Sage--sucha a great note when used well--was absent and even wood, the most used note in perfumery to date, was nowhere to be found. Pleasant, air freshener sort of scent. 1st July 2015158888rogalalShow all reviewsTo me, Wood Sage & Sea Salt smells mostly like ionones, those chemicals that smell like violets over suede. There's quite a bit of pink pepper as well, which serves mainly as a familiar touchstone because it's in so many fruity florals, so it keeps this from every smelling too \"weird\" or \"niche\". Beyond this perfumey suede-ish mixture, I can just barely perceive whiffs of plywood and cherry, and there's a buttery tone to everything as well.I can't smell any sage or sea salt to save my life, and think this may have been more accurate if it had been called \"Cherry Musk\" or \"Violets & Suede\", but it's OK for what it is. It's not particularly compelling, but it's been years since Jo Malone has released anything truly compelling, so it's just par for the course at this point. It's essentially a Cuir de Russie, but with all the grit and shine polished off and replaced with a sense of familiarity, though it very much doesn't smell like a dumbed-down mall perfume either. It's not bad, but I'm just not quite ready to give this a thumbs up either... 28th May 2015157207odysseusmShow all reviewsWhen its good there isn't enough of it, and when its bad there's too much.The citrus and sage is green and refreshing but VERY faint.

A vague, soapy-detergent smell. 4th May 2015155799PerseveroShow all reviewsBought this after being pounced on by Jo Malone representative at Stansted Airport. Attractive, clean scent but unfortunately loses its force very rapidly. 24th February 2015152282landshark321Show all reviewsThis is the first cologne by Ja Malone that I've worn (I tried a cologne intense, Velvet Rose & Oud), and the projection and overall strength of Wood Sage & Sea Salt are already noticeably different within an hour of spraying---so limited, in fact, that I'm reasonably sure it will be gone within a few hours, though I'll update if I'm wrong.It's a pleasant summer scent, with, apart from its named ingredients, musk and something sweet, perhaps citrus. And perhaps its lightness means that it will perform better in the summer, as I'm testing it out in the winter, though I feel the winter test is a better baseline for performance. It is a very agreeable scent, not likely to offend, but not particularly daring as an aquatic or woody scent. Nonetheless I could certainly see this being a summer staple for either gender because it is unoffensive, and a harmonious mix of salt, wood, and hits of spiciness and sweetness. It leans slightly toward Tom Ford's Costa Azzurra on scent, but of course not strength.If the strength weren't such an issue, I might have higher regard for this fragrance, but even though named a cologne, it is still too weak to consider buying, especially at its price points (30ml for $60, 100ml for $120). The cologne intense I tried at least seemed to offer some bang for some bucks.6 out of 10 5th February 2015151509LCasimiroShow all reviewsThis is a beautiful clean scent, perfect for a Texas Fall day.

A balance of what seems like white florals, some citrus/fruit, some light wood, and slight musk, though I can't really pick out any individual notes. A little powdery and clean but not soapy or musty. Soft and comforting; cohesive and well-balanced; atmospheric. Despite some reviews that say \"synthetic\", fairly natural smelling for me. Unisex and somewhat indistinctive, but also inoffensive. Moderate longevity. On me it doesn't project much/stays close to the skin.That said, I don't know if I'll be wearing it too much, as I prefer scents that make more of a statement, are stronger, or have prominent notes--more character, and frankly, more masculine. 24th April 2022258168Jon_RemyShow all reviewsThis came out in 1989, not 1994. I was on a plane to Munich when another passenger said she worked for the Calvin Klein company and was incidentally carrying a sample of CK One in her purse, which she gave to me. She said it was a unisex fragrance (something new at the time). I thanked her, and have loved CK One ever since 1989. 16th April 2021241687ADVERTISEMENTNe Plus UltraShow all reviewsAs far as fragrances that were released during the 90s (I'm not including frags released in the late 80s; like Cool Water, Joop, or CK's Eternity in this one) there were a handful of fragrances that achieved ubiquitousness in an era they were made in - Calvin Klein's One, being one (no pun intended) of them. In fact, I think the only other fragrance that beats CK One as a time capsule of the 1990s is: Acqua di Giò.Like Acqua di Giò, this scent was everywhere in the 90s. Probably even more so, because it was (as it is now) cheaper than Acqua di Giò.Disclaimer: this review might be a little biased due in part to nostalgia. Smelling this fragrance again; I can hear Ace of Base's \"The Sign\" bouncing along in the overhead speakers while walking around in the mall when I was a kid.I don't know how long past formulations lasted. But, in it's current form; 6 hours, at best.First notes to greet the nose; is a lemon/citrus smell, very comparable to a gin & tonic smell. Accompanying the slighty boozy citrus smell is a vaguely synthetic smelling floral scent - think of roses or tulips. There's also a very subtle feminine tone underlying the floral/citrus/fresh smells; to me, it reminds me of a women's salon shampoo.Projection lasts about an hour. After that, the citrus notes taper off, and the floral scent plateaus.Hour 3-4: the citrus takes a back seat to the green tea and sandalwood. By this point, it is a fresh/floral scent.Hour 4-5: Basically, a skin scent at this point. Citrus smell is mostly gone.Hour 6: Whatever sillage left on the skin, has evaporated or been absorbed, by this point. Any residual smell left, now lingers on your clothes; your shirt will smell vaguely of dryer sheets.And that's about it; It's neither very remarkable, nor very bad. It's just...your basic, safe, clean, inoffensive (for the most part), scent...and, that's part of the problem with it.CK One suffers from a couple of problems: 1. It's a people-pleasing fragrance from Calvin Klein; so it's going to be a somewhat of a milquetoast, synthetic, middle of the road fragrance to some people - especially after 25+ years of being on the market.2. It's a unisex fragrance; it ends up straddling a fence between feminine/masculine which makes it smell more generic than it otherwise would have.3. It could end up being either too masculine or too feminine on you; depending on your body chemistry and what sex you are. On me, I find it to be a little on the feminine side within the first hour: it's the floral scent mixed with women's haircare product smell. To me, this is a daytime scent; wear this at the office or casual weekend afternoons. Technically, this might be considered an \"all-season\" fragrance. But, I would classify it as a spring/summertime scent. Again, it's just a workhorse fragrance for the office or running errands on a spring/summer day below 75°.I would recommend this people who are new to fragrances, and basically want a cheap, inoffensive, safe scent they can use everyday.3.25/5 stars. Just barely above a neutral rating for me. 18th March 2021241812AbbissShow all reviewsThis review is going to be a bit contradictory. So was the fragrance. I shared my boyfriend's bottle when I was 18 and he was 38. That's 13 years ago. I still have the memories of a fresh fragrance with citrus and woods, that I found cool in my pseudo-feminist young and free years, but also too masculine for what I was thinking I should smell like. It felt like the notes were chosen to balance each other, to the point of zero, like opposite-coloured lights would make the sum of them look white. 27th October 2018208605Varanis RidariShow all reviewsReviewing generalist scents always brings up the problem of not only setting the facts strait amongst all the unintelligible and extreme two-liner reviews that either skyrocket or tank the scent's ratings, but also of accurately describing them with enough specifics to make them seem distinct to the reader without smelling them, since generalists are not meant to be distinct by their nature, with cK One (1994) being the ultimate generalist. The hot take version of this review is cK One is essentially an Alyssa Ashley Musk (1968) 2.0, but for more, read on. The mass-appeal fragrance model always existed but not until the 90's did it cast such an impossibly wide net, with new creations resetting all the levels on things from the past and striving to be as inoffensive and unspecific as possible, in an attempt to reclaim respect and acceptance lost by the very brash and ostentatious 1980's. This process began in earnest first with masculine fragrances as male \"powerhouse\" scents were often the most bizarre and virile, while female-marketed scents were no less loud but commanding in a more charismatic way than by brute force, so they didn't transition into the \"fresh revolution\" until later on. Calvin Klein is much to blame for this entire changing of the guard, as they were among the vanguard of perfumers offering a new generation of unassuming olfactory pleasantness, but kept going further and further in that direction by using increasing numbers of nondescript custom synthetics (often with fantastic names in the note pyramids) until their perfumes smelled like nothing recognizable in the real world. Removing nature from perfume was relatively easy, as enough blending can achieve that even without synthetics, but the next step in Calvin Klein's efforts to \"smell like nothing\" would be to remove gender as well, which led to the creation of cK One in 1994. Now to be clear, unisex fragrances actually predate all other kinds of perfume, as fragrances did not have gender, despite being favored mostly by women in western culture for centuries, and only received sexual assignment after insecure guys made it clear they needed their own special scents with reassurance of masculinity if they were to wear any fragrance at all. Many niche and high-end perfume houses have never really taken to labeling their creations by gender until exclusive \"for men\" fragrances came about, and some still don't assign gender even to this day. However, in regards to mainstream perfume, Calvin Klein deliberately marketing cK One as \"unisex\" by design became a huge deal and mind-blower to those who didn't know better. The \"Age of Eternity\" was in full-swing by the advant of cK One, and it's \"One for All\" attitude spawned a wave of unisex clones from other houses throughout the decade, plus created a cult following that to this day buys up every flanker and seasonal alternate version released. Alberto Morillas, who even by 1994 had an impressive portfolio of creations, was brought in by Calvin Klein to spearhead the cK One effort, with Harry Freemont, who is also known for a lot of winners in the designer segment. Together, they created a scent that is basically so intent on being gender-neutral from a perfume aesthetics perspective, that it literally comprises notes that act to neutralize each other, making the most anonymous and androgynous of beige pleasantries ever smelled at the time. cK One is constantly fighting itself in the dry down, creating a silent maelstrom of opposing forces that smell both like a dozen things you've smelled before and also none of them simultaneously. This amazing and admittedly confusing feat begins with bergamot, lemon, mandarin, pineapple, papaya, and cardamom, which is a \"we are the world\" of citrus minus maybe lime, counterbalanced by rounder fruit choices and a meaty spice. The next level of Dante's Inferno in a bottle comes in the form of jasmine hedione, violet, rose, muguet, freesia, and nutmeg, which swings the the composition feminine from all the florals at first but soon swings the pendulum back to the guy side with nutmeg. Green tea, oakmoss, cedar, sandalwood, amber, the only synthetic \"Kleinism\" in the form of \"green tree accord\" and finally white musk bring the base into territory inhabited by unisex musk perfumes of the 1960's, without the hippie sweat factor of heavy aromatics. The conflict these accords undertake with each other is less of a free-for-all and more of a standoff a la trench warfare of the first world war. You catch a glimpse of something like citrus, then the fruit holds it in check. Violet and rose begin painting a dainty and dusty feminine picture until nutmeg stamps it out. Cedar and oakmoss begin to anchor the base in barbershop territory until the sweet amber and laundry musk neutralize the effort. The whole thing is literally just checks and balances from top to bottom, which is both exhausting to parse, and ultimately blurs into the perfume equivalent of \"apartment white\" carpeting. It goes on sweet, bright, then goes floral, and finally ends in clean musk that's hard not to like. High school teens everywhere throughout the 90's obsessed over this, thanks to pictures full of despondent 20-somethings in grungy jeans, white shirts, and edgy haircuts that plastered every subway, bus stop, airport, and magazine insert in the US. Ironically, I remember some total chauvinists back in the day refused to wear cK One because to them, a scent that was unisex was tantamount to just being women's perfume anyway, which was their loss. cK One set another precedent for Calvin Klein, who already ushered in the serenity that was Eternity for Men (1989), then came along with this scent so everyone and their sister, brother, cousin, or mother could smell clean, unobtrusive, and completely alike. I know it sounds like a fragrance trying to smell like nothing would be terrible, and for many a purist this was blasphemy, but those folks subsequently moved either into vintage scents or niche depending on their economic upward mobility anyway, leaving the designers behind to court the masses, which may have been their end game all along. Who's to say? One thing is certain, there's so much effort and creativity worked into this scent by Mr. Morillas and Freemont, plus so many nearly-imperceptible sides to cK One as a result of it's highly-synthetic blending, that it's hard not to appreciate the artistry here even from a hobbyist standpoint, if not the style of the scent itself. For those who love the puzzle box in the frosted medicine bottle that is cK One, wearings in different temperatures will reveal a great deal of versatility. Like most generalists before and after, you don't really have to think about wearing cK One, and it becomes the \"dumb-grab\" for the person in a hurry, which itself has moved more units than probably any other reason that can be found in this review. Safe and sexy in one package is the way to sell units, and designers learned from this going forward, gendered or not. The smell of cK One will yield many a compliment by men or women, as was by design, if that's something which interests you, but it is not a very distinguished nor distinguishable smell, so people wanting to be credited for their good taste are looking in the wrong place here. I find cK One to be the height of Calvin Klein's innovative perfume art through artifice approach, and although later 90's output was also nice, including the unisex sequel cK Be (1996), a certain nadir would set in by the mid-2000's that would culminate in their attempts to relearn diversity by the 2010's with mixed results. cK One is still the best of it's line to me despite being the first, because it is still the most sophisticated, well-blended, gender-neutral, and rounded of the cK scents. It's attempts at minimalism is something it's sequels achieve more successfully, at the cost of quality or true unisex appeal. I also like to think the use of cK One encourages moving outside the comfort zones and exploring other possibilities, because one thinks \"if I can wear this, what else can I do?\". It's cheap, it's pallid, and ends in a simple musk finish, but it's also quite liberating. Cheers! 27th May 2018202168IjustwannasmellgoodShow all reviewsI'd say I approached CK One with the lowest expectations possible. Judging by the reviews, it had been an overdone and highly unoriginal smell that had lost its initial glory to what came after it.I'm happy to say that isn't true in the least. CK One is a surprisingly fresh and versatile fragrance with pretty strong sillage and good longevity. The citrus-y opening with a hint of pineapple and bergamot is somewhat sweet and leads into a semi sweet floral bouquet with Jasmine and violet as it later quiets down into a soft woody accord that smells like walking fresh out of the shower.This is the perfect juice for anybody who wants to just spray and go without worrying about the smell. It's the penultimate symbol of easygoing softness and freshness that so many fragrances strive for and never quite grasp. This is the most compliments I've gotten from a fragrance.Even after all this time, CK One is a winner. Well done, Mr. Morillas. Absolutely recommended.Longevity: 6-8 hoursSillage: High 28th April 2018200781ASKJShow all reviewsI have nothing bad to say about CK One because it is so inoffensive. It's an elegant fragrance of a natural freshness in a subdued and balanced blend. It's not too sweet, not attention seeking, fresh, features natural smells, long lasting and stays close to the skin. So far so good.With that in mind, my first impression of CK One is that it belongs in the same fragrance family as laundry soap, it's a most luxurious laundry soap - but still a laundry soap. I can only speak for myself when I say I love clean smelling clothes. The kind of clothing smell which radiates a calm feeling throughout the day. Except that the fabric softener I use is much cheaper than CK one. I like CK One, I don't love it, and it's never the wrong choice of fragrance in any situation. 25th September 2017191782Brian BuchananShow all reviewscK One : that unmistakable smell of 'citrus', green tea and muguet; luminous, aloof, androgynous and hard. With its motto of 'clean is the new sexy' cK One squared the circle and became the first major puritan perfume. No mean feat : some mean 'fume. 27th August 2017266430jtdShow all reviewsA friend brought up CK One yesterday in a discussion. The Calvin Klein names sound the same to me and it only clicked which CK perfume this was when I remembered the advertising campaign. The teenage faux-grunge advertising. Oy.I'll tell you how it is that I've never smelled CK One before: target marketing works. In 1994 and I was 30, or twice the age of the target audience. I lived in New York and CK One advertising was public. In 1994, before social media, targeting simply wasn't very precise. Rather than aiming, Calvin Klein flooded. Billboards, television, magazines and newspapers, subway posters. I had to swerve to avoid it. If CK One launched today I'd simply never see it. It just wouldn't show up in any of my feeds.CK One was intended for a young audience, but the images were in everyone's face, so a sort of self-recusal took place on-by-one. The perfume appealed to you or not, depending largely on whether the story being created included you. Imagery that read as cool/aspirational to the 21 year old who found the ads exciting didn't appeal to me. Thin, world-weary teens playing Peter Pan meets Lord of the Flies? It screamed significance in fashion patois, but the post-grunge styling was years late and a shoddy attempt to cop a style from a subculture. The CK One campaign started a few months after Kurt Cobain killed himself. The notion of Calvin Klein trying to catch some momentum from grunge at this particular time was repugnant.So I opted out. I was obliged to continue to see the images–I mean, I rode the subways–but that was the end of my participation. The contempt wore off after about a week. Then I just navigated the images until the next thing came along and replaced them–a classic New York experience of my time.I remember a couple of details about the perfume. It was unisex.' I was surprised that they made a big deal of it–was unisex that novel an idea? Also, the fragrance was supposed to be contemporary and clean. SO contemporary and SO clean that it was somehow beyond scent.So I tried CK One cold' yesterday for the first time. I've never read about the perfume itself. I have a bottle of CK One and some 25 year old recollections of the launch.CK One smells like it was intended to convey hygiene yet go unnoticed. It's there, but it claims not to intrude into your consciousness. There's been years of discussion about the contradiction and denial involved in fragrances trying to smell like nothing, so I'm sure applying the notion to CK One is nothing new. But CK One smells like a very specific nothing. It's conceptual: a clean' fragrance + a masking fragrance = an impulse of purity. It allows you to feel invigorated without the invasiveness and effort of having to exhibit a clean scent. From the angle of 2017, hygienic fragrances seem very '90s-specific, but for all I know, CK One invented the approach.Of course the premise that two opposing olfactory forces will nullify each other doesn't actually work on a practical level. Instead, you're left with the remnants of a scent, like dry-cleaning chemicals that cling to your clothing. The perfume ends up locked in a cycle of constantly trying to invalidate itself. It might have been intended to be uncomplicated and undemanding, but it's no surprise that it smells like effort and tension. (Cute bottle, though.)It also smells like diet soda and Febreze, which wouldn't exist for another another 4 years. I give CK One enormous credit for its methodically synthetic tone. It comes across as calculated and legible. I had never smelled it before yesterday, and yet it instantly smelled like an era. If CK One's goal was to create a new style of fragrance, my experience points out how successful it was.from scenthurdle.com 20th July 2017189076MaddyShow all reviewsI could've sworn I reviewed this already. Since it seems that I haven't, I'll do so now.What else is there to say, but wow? Back in 2015, before my first semester at college was over, I found this at a Burlington. I had only ever used one fragrance prior to getting this, and this is what got me into the fragrance game (I now have at least a dozen fragrances).I had no idea what this would smell like, but I knew about Calvin Klein because my dad has worn two of their fragrances: eternity and obsession. I had no idea how to tell if it was a \"cologne\" or \"perfume\", but I decided to go for it. I tried it on in the car and realized that I had smelled it before. It was (and is) a very popular fragrance. Most of its users are women, but this is also a hit among younger men (like myself). I think what I smelled was a combination of musk, green tree accord, pineapple and violet. Those scents are what stick out to me. It's a very casual and relaxing scent. As another reviewer has said, it has \"90s\" written all over it. 6th July 2017188445The sent of rotten tacosShow all reviewsAhh mid 90's every guy had ck one every girl wore tommy girl. I love this smell prolly mostly because of what it reminds me of more than the actual smell. It was clutch in its prime tho!

It's a living legend of a scent, controversial and an acquired taste.Wearing it, I feel sensations of confidence (no doubt from the citrus notes) and comfort. It's a head turner that still sticks out after all these years.I haven't tried to explore the dizzying array of cK One flankers that have come out since the original came out in 1994 - and I won't knock them until I try them. But cK One is one to check out, man or woman. 24th December 2016180510Shifty BatShow all reviewsI actually grew to enjoy One after owning a mini for several years. Surely it is synthetic and a little crowded, but it is refreshing and unisex, which is exactly what it claimed to be, and I like that. Perhaps it's the changing climes and trends making masculine florals so rare which changed my mind on this one, but I really like lily of the valley in fragrances, and to me, it is the most prominent part of One's composition. If the base wasn't so blurred and fake smelling this might have crossed the line from good to great. Edit: The line has been crossed. I have finally acquired a vintage bottle and am happy to report that it is warmer, more natural-smelling, and that the sourness of the opening is more like aldehydes than chemical tartness derived from added citruses, and the nutmeg is actually noticeable. Admittedly, the difference in vintages is a small gap, and the current formulation is still far more enjoyable than most designer releases over the last two decades, but that little difference in texture and authenticity bridged the gap for me. 11th September 2016181371cake-loveShow all reviewsI love it. I was a little too young to have worn it when it was in fashion, and probably would've hated it, anyway. Now I love it, a kind of techno-citrus that screams a kind of otherworldly calm. Like it would be saying \"relax, it's the 90s\" if it cared to speak, but instead it just gives a smug look to everyone it saunters past walking down the street back to its translucent plastic spaceship. 11th July 2016174335TheonGreyjoyShow all reviewsIt's light, not too feminine, and unoffensive. I've kept it around for years, and still enjoy wearing it to work, where it doesn't sweat off.

Two decades later, I really enjoy CK1 -- especially for everyday wear, to the office. It is clean yet not astringent like many water-inspired scents. With my body chemistry, CK1 takes on a slightly floral, powdery, feminine tone. It is not a sexy scent on me, nor it does it inspire a sense of adventure. But I select this scent when I want to feel fresh, professional, and feminine. I realize that CK1 is famous for being the first gender-neutral fragrance; but it smells feminine (floral/powdery) with my body chemistry. 5th January 2016166446Le_Coeur_GothiqueShow all reviewsOne to shine...Since I'm good in crafts, I'm thinking of making a belt with two holsters, all Far West and stuff, and pack two 200ml bottles of this little wunderwaffe all the time. Cause this looker is a life saver in all its salience. And a delight savourer in all its clarity too. It carries an one of a kind charisma to dissipate any troubles that may be thrown your way.Traffic jam? Spray some!Boring chore? Spray galore!Dulled desires?Galling quagmires?Psychic vampires?Spray some more!There's nothing this beaut can't handle. Even getting the \"poet\" out of me. Even enjoying its own bipolarity by being two different fragrances, depending on where you spray it. Citrusy and musky clouds on my wrist, salty bitter woods in the crook of my elbow (whilst crooking it).It almost changed my attitude towards Calvin Klein, since I never thought of them as a truly memorable perfume house producing fragrances with the potential to become legendary over time. Who knows, perhaps they were never meant to concoct august heavy hitters, but rather sanguine and happy carefree vagrants.Oh, and its bottle makes an excellent atypical and kooky case of a hip flask when empty.Cheers! 30th November 2015164881clamnoleShow all reviewsI bought CK One when it first came out because it seemed to me to be cutting edge at the time of the newly popular fresh scents that were hitting the market in the 90's. It didn't disappoint, I loved wearing it to casual dinners or afternoon sports events. In fact, I think I kept it in my locker at my country club for most of the time I owned it.I still like the scent today, but it's not one I want to own again. I'm older and it doesn't feel or smell right for me anymore.Great fragrance for a young man IMO, and definately a winner for Calvin Klein and Co. 13th February 2015151819Sago PalmShow all reviewsI'm quite fond of this fragrance. My sister's signature fragrance, and I associate it with her and her home, lots of fun times with her during some special chapters in our lives. It's fresh and clean, slightly citrus-y and in a word, \"pleasant\".I recognize it occasionally when out and about, as it's noticeable on others, but not loud. A colleague of mine also wore it and I'd compliment her often on her fragrance choice. It leaves a homey trail when the wearer passes, always making me smile. When I moved on from that place of work, she gifted me with a bottle to remind me of her, which I still use occasionally. It's very comforting and was such a sweet memento. 18th October 2014147471NOiDONThaveBOShow all reviewsI think this is great. There is a feeling to it that I find similar to M.I. by Creed and it can be had for so cheap.

To me it's more of an after-shower refresher (not unlike 4711, which famously marketed itself as \"the refreshant cologne\" for many years). On my skin it's barely detectable after ten minutes --- which is fine, because then I can apply a real fragrance with some staying power, if I'm so inclined.As a fragrance, it's too bland and unobjectionable to dislike. To paraphrase Gertrude Stein, \"there's no 'there' there.\" On a hot day or after a shower --- sure, but again, it doesn't last, and doesn't really smell like anything except a generic \"fresh\" for a few minutes. 6th June 2022260123FSOCI3TYShow all reviewsFor the price, it's pretty good. However, the Lily of the Valley note didn't really impress me, so I sold the bottle soon after purchasing it. Green and slightly powdery, with some generic citruses to keep it bright. It's light so respray it as often as needed.It's just boring. Perhaps this brings nostalgic memories for those growing up in the 1990s. It's definitely not a bad scent, but it didn't really live up to its hype. It's more of an expectation mismanagement that's to blame. 10th March 2022256037ADVERTISEMENTBrissoShow all reviewsOne third Z 14, one third Tuscany, one third CK One.

That sounds about right.It's not bad smell, but this has nothing which would make it any more recommendable than the hundreds of other colognes which smell like alcohol and citrus, with no sophistication or distinction. 4th February 2012104372bFlayShow all reviewsF-f-fruity! Yet another fragrance I find it hard to imagine a man enjoying. I bought it blind a couple years ago and wore it about a dozen times, mostly for work. It is basically inoffensive, but unexciting and has quite poor longevity. Might be good for a teenager. I wouldn't purchase it for myself again. 19th November 2011100826ShpatiShow all reviewsJust an average scent to be honest. Smells like fresh cloths to me. It is just a nice pleasing scent. Nothing special.Personally, I think this is great to wear before bed or while hanging out at home. Keeps you smelling nice without killing your revenue. 21st October 201199531DutchSchwagShow all reviewsCalvin Klein was always about two things in the 1990´s, at least in the fragrance realm, and both of those were inter-related. Packaging and marketing, with packaging an extension of the Bauhaus minimalism meets 1990´s existentialist faux-artsy commercials being crafted to coalesce into a middle-class neo-riche.This stuff is beautifully packaged, the elixir jar another one of Klein´s subtle but smart campaigns of simplicity implying sophistication and class. But ultimately things come down to quality and substance, though CK One may have been groundbreaking in its reach and stretch and in the colognes that soon followed, CK One does not seem to stand out all that particularly well against its proteges these days. In fact, to be blunt, the reformulation smells quite cheap and uninspired. That doesn't mean it always was, because at its top, the lemon citrus bite and floral accords that rise to the surface shortly after the opening do have a certain charm and unique blending, especially given its time period. This seems better as a nice every-day skin soother rather than a reliable cologne. Longevity on this is somewhat tame, 3-4 hours can even be quite ambitious and unattainable. That must be why the reformulation comes in such massive quantity. The notes themselves are a creative blending of citrus, floral and tea, with jasmine seeming to standout in what might constitute as a bit of a mess, but a nice mess all the same. It certainly helped open the door for the success of Acqua di Gio and many other aquatic based fragrances and for that a certain respectability has to be given, but overall, CK One is simply nothing too exceptional to seek out beyond wanting to pay homage to a historical trendsetter or as an after-shower body after shave for the soul. Weak longevity and maybe a bit above average projection for an aquatic, but expires far too quickly for its price-tag. A refreshing musky background persists all the way through which seems to work with the other ingredients. A bit daft and ordinary in a modern sense, but that's only because CK One's incarnation itself helped lead the way to more open doors in the fragrance market. For that reason, should be respected, but nothing to seek out for its own sake as a head-turn. The reformulation leans more towards the synthetic and floral. 16th March 201187251alfaromShow all reviewsThis review is to talk about all of the Calvin Klein classics (one / be /obession / escape / eternity etc. etc.). A bunch of them were ok, a few of them even good, but a lot of them were just perfumed water for ironing with the CK monogram on the bottle. The problem, thou, it's not with the perfumes themselves but instead with the fact that in a certain period almost everybody was wearing a CK creation. I can say I never tried one of these scent personally but instead I passively suffered them all. I started to develope an allergy and grew it in the years. What I can say for sure is, sooo bad for me, they had an incredible commercial feedback. I will survive! 5th March 201186360DarvantShow all reviewsI tend to admire the usage of tea in the olfactory universe This is basically a scent grounded over tea where a fresh dominant tea note drags some fruits and flowers towards a musky and ambery base. A complex blast of citric elements, fruits and nocturnal flowers dominates the top and the middle notes while a tea note links it to a musky, amber drydown. I detect some Paco's trait and a touch of Bvlgari classic Pour Homme based over gree tea. The feminine trait of this unisex marketed fragrance is grounded by floral notes as lily, violet, jasmine and rose even CK One is masculine to me. I apreciate the invigorating effect from tea and the fresh, herbal, musky, nocturnal trait. A bit too fruity for my taste. Quite decent fragrance anyway. 22nd January 2011133775Relent de ChevalerieShow all reviewsOddly enough, I was never made aware this fragrance was aimed for unisex marketing until I read reviews on this site. In fact, I wore it long ago because CK was becoming popular around me and we all thought it was the cool, masculine thing to do. Was it the fact it was something of a non-threatening male kind of accord manly yet sensitive- that was so appealing to us youngsters back then? I can't really say. One thing for sure, I had just been heartbroken by someone wearing Obsession and couldn't find it in me to wear that one again. Leaving me, she had thrown me back to square one. I needed to find some new hope that love was out there; that someone, somewhere, waited for me to meet her. I eventually became enrapt by spiritualism and stopped wearing it. The fact that a lot of people around me ended up wearing it might have also influenced my choice to opt for something else, I think. What I could remember of it was that it had a pleasant citrus glow to it. Revisiting the past and stimulated by the reviews on basenotes, I wore it again not too long ago. I would say I find it to be an interesting one. Realizing online that it was meant as a unisex scent, it now seems to me to have become much more popular amongst men than it has amongst women. Was it that the non-threatening male was becoming en vogue back then but the feminine models such as Nikita and the subsequent others had yet to make their appearances? I can't say.My socio-cultural musings put aside, CK One comes off, at first, as citrus and a green something… like… fougère, I'd say. I don't get the pineapple and, if I search for it, just a bit of the papaya. The accord presents itself more like citrus and green to me. It does, especially, if I just try to get a general gist of it. Its core notes feel more floral and I get a jasmine, nutmeg and a green something that isn't really fougère anymore. Violet and rose? No, not really. The musk and amber/green in the base notes that I perceive, when it's reached its drydown, I have to say, are quite nice too. It all boils down to a nice fragrance, especially since its popularity has faded and that I'm living in China where it's not so well known. Also, the fact it now has memories attached to it must surely help. 17th January 201075140RedbeardShow all reviews(Writing side-by-side with Eternity) Starts out as a lemony aquatic, and reasonably strong. I'm really impressed with the top, as it does the \"fresh and clean, laundry and shower\" thing in such a captivating way compared to others of its type, albeit slightly synthetic. Is there maybe even a little tea, or at least Synth-O-Tea? There's enough of that, or something herbal, to keep it from being as \"perfumey\" and sweet as Eternity, even though I find it stronger. It starts to get a little musky over time, retaining a sharp element if you breathe it deeply. At this point, I realize that it's starting to turn into Ass-Leather, that basenote of cheap aquatics that always feels so contrived to me, so I'm a bit let down. Plus something licoricey develops, which really puts me off. In spite of this fall from grace, the topnotes entice me enough to elicit a neutral thumb, and I could be persuaded to wear it if push came to shove. 19th December 200957092lexShow all reviewsnotes clashing with ck one in the beginning. but it do not smell like a bunch of chemicals just notes. with that said its not a bad frag. its light sits close to the skin with a light lotion musk. 19th November 200928150DiamondflameShow all reviewsBright, clean smelling...a 'happy' scent.

My partner was going to buy a bottle recently,but luckily was talked out of it !! A fragrance of its time !I'll give it a neutral rating as I used to wear it,but just seems to be unrefined and crass now ! 25th July 200971489terrypittsShow all reviewsWhen I take the time to smell One and sort out the ingredients, it strikes me as a pleasant mix. But when I just take a whiff of what I'm wearing, I find it overall rather blah. This might be a case when the parts don't add up to be a whole. 23rd June 200969044NDSinBKKShow all reviewsI think this is my first review - what better place to start than with...One.It may also be a good place to end. This cologne is so light it's like goose down, it's almost weightless. As in invisible. On me I can barely detect a trace of it after just a few minutes.On the positive side, it has a very fresh smell when it goes on. That flattens out in a hurry to a kind of inobtrusive, unobjectionable aroma that is kind of attractive, though it does not smell like anything that occurs naturally.I can't recognize a single one of the Top, Middle, or Base notes. If I were flat out guessing, I'd be aiming at imaginary chemicals, like extract of ammonium hydrate, essence of fluorocarbon, natural ozone, etc.I kind of like it, in a post-modern kind of way, for the full 15 minutes it lasts. 2nd June 200967020Kabamaru ninjaShow all reviewsThis scent to me is under the average very flowery and too much \"happy\"to me.Its a classic after all this succeeded years and but if it wasn't I d saythat it is a thump down one! 29th September 20086132312 Next Most reviews in the last weekmanlyscents (8)Colbourne (8)Varanis Ridari (4)exmin (3)landshark321 (3)RoamingRose (3)speedracer (3)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)SPACEDOUT (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (27)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (8)Lian (7)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

I decided to go out today and buy another one as I totally loved the smell. Just got home and gave myself a quick squirt and am totally disappointed. Calvin Klein have totally changed the way that is smells. Gone is the wonderful fruity aroma that would last almost all day. In place of it is something I struggle to describe.

The opening is somewhat like a traditional cologne tempered with harsh synthetics and fermenting fruits. Carries a light, musky, fresh base. I pass on this one. Try it at Macy's if you haven't already. 14th November 200942576MOONBShow all reviewsI gave this a try, once or twice.Look, the thing is I don't think you can expect too much from a CK fragrance. And my expectations were pretty low when I tried this. Please keep in mind, I'm 27 now, and I think it was only a year or two ago that I gave CK One a chance. So I don't think I'm the right age, or even the marketers' target age for this smell.I find this to be far too sweet-smelling, and far too synthetic. I know it's supposed to be unisex, but that's odd, because I don't find anything about randomly combining summer fruits and florals to be either masculine or feminine. It all just seems a bit youthful and childish, and carries itself that way - albeit boldly - which doesn't say much to favor it. Like almost everything else that came out of the '90s, this is contrived and sub-par. unless you're between the ages of 14 - 18, I'd avoid CK One and wear something that smells better. 5th November 200973841pinkfizzyShow all reviewsSmells like pineapple juice and citrus dishsoap and cheap musks. Not my thing. And for a \"light\" scent, it's surprisingly tenacious, like L'Eau D'Issey. I could still smell it after a vigorous handwashing.

Actually makes me want to clear my throat and spit. How did something so toxic make it by the test panel? Could be one of those either/or notes that some people pick up and others are oblivious to.

Oh, okay, like that means you're not supposed to stink, right? NOT! This is one of the worst I've smelled! And it smells cheap and sickly! It's very nauseating to smell and wear. One of Klein's worst. It's very sharp, crisp and strong when first applying, but that sweet-sour chemical odor! It's on my bug repellent list.

A balance of what seems like white florals, some citrus/fruit, some light wood, and slight musk, though I can't really pick out any individual notes. A little powdery and clean but not soapy or musty. Soft and comforting; cohesive and well-balanced; atmospheric. Despite some reviews that say \"synthetic\", fairly natural smelling for me. Unisex and somewhat indistinctive, but also inoffensive. Moderate longevity. On me it doesn't project much/stays close to the skin.That said, I don't know if I'll be wearing it too much, as I prefer scents that make more of a statement, are stronger, or have prominent notes--more character, and frankly, more masculine. 24th April 2022258168Jon_RemyShow all reviewsThis came out in 1989, not 1994. I was on a plane to Munich when another passenger said she worked for the Calvin Klein company and was incidentally carrying a sample of CK One in her purse, which she gave to me. She said it was a unisex fragrance (something new at the time). I thanked her, and have loved CK One ever since 1989. 16th April 2021241687ADVERTISEMENTNe Plus UltraShow all reviewsAs far as fragrances that were released during the 90s (I'm not including frags released in the late 80s; like Cool Water, Joop, or CK's Eternity in this one) there were a handful of fragrances that achieved ubiquitousness in an era they were made in - Calvin Klein's One, being one (no pun intended) of them. In fact, I think the only other fragrance that beats CK One as a time capsule of the 1990s is: Acqua di Giò.Like Acqua di Giò, this scent was everywhere in the 90s. Probably even more so, because it was (as it is now) cheaper than Acqua di Giò.Disclaimer: this review might be a little biased due in part to nostalgia. Smelling this fragrance again; I can hear Ace of Base's \"The Sign\" bouncing along in the overhead speakers while walking around in the mall when I was a kid.I don't know how long past formulations lasted. But, in it's current form; 6 hours, at best.First notes to greet the nose; is a lemon/citrus smell, very comparable to a gin & tonic smell. Accompanying the slighty boozy citrus smell is a vaguely synthetic smelling floral scent - think of roses or tulips. There's also a very subtle feminine tone underlying the floral/citrus/fresh smells; to me, it reminds me of a women's salon shampoo.Projection lasts about an hour. After that, the citrus notes taper off, and the floral scent plateaus.Hour 3-4: the citrus takes a back seat to the green tea and sandalwood. By this point, it is a fresh/floral scent.Hour 4-5: Basically, a skin scent at this point. Citrus smell is mostly gone.Hour 6: Whatever sillage left on the skin, has evaporated or been absorbed, by this point. Any residual smell left, now lingers on your clothes; your shirt will smell vaguely of dryer sheets.And that's about it; It's neither very remarkable, nor very bad. It's just...your basic, safe, clean, inoffensive (for the most part), scent...and, that's part of the problem with it.CK One suffers from a couple of problems: 1. It's a people-pleasing fragrance from Calvin Klein; so it's going to be a somewhat of a milquetoast, synthetic, middle of the road fragrance to some people - especially after 25+ years of being on the market.2. It's a unisex fragrance; it ends up straddling a fence between feminine/masculine which makes it smell more generic than it otherwise would have.3. It could end up being either too masculine or too feminine on you; depending on your body chemistry and what sex you are. On me, I find it to be a little on the feminine side within the first hour: it's the floral scent mixed with women's haircare product smell. To me, this is a daytime scent; wear this at the office or casual weekend afternoons. Technically, this might be considered an \"all-season\" fragrance. But, I would classify it as a spring/summertime scent. Again, it's just a workhorse fragrance for the office or running errands on a spring/summer day below 75°.I would recommend this people who are new to fragrances, and basically want a cheap, inoffensive, safe scent they can use everyday.3.25/5 stars. Just barely above a neutral rating for me. 18th March 2021241812AbbissShow all reviewsThis review is going to be a bit contradictory. So was the fragrance. I shared my boyfriend's bottle when I was 18 and he was 38. That's 13 years ago. I still have the memories of a fresh fragrance with citrus and woods, that I found cool in my pseudo-feminist young and free years, but also too masculine for what I was thinking I should smell like. It felt like the notes were chosen to balance each other, to the point of zero, like opposite-coloured lights would make the sum of them look white. 27th October 2018208605Varanis RidariShow all reviewsReviewing generalist scents always brings up the problem of not only setting the facts strait amongst all the unintelligible and extreme two-liner reviews that either skyrocket or tank the scent's ratings, but also of accurately describing them with enough specifics to make them seem distinct to the reader without smelling them, since generalists are not meant to be distinct by their nature, with cK One (1994) being the ultimate generalist. The hot take version of this review is cK One is essentially an Alyssa Ashley Musk (1968) 2.0, but for more, read on. The mass-appeal fragrance model always existed but not until the 90's did it cast such an impossibly wide net, with new creations resetting all the levels on things from the past and striving to be as inoffensive and unspecific as possible, in an attempt to reclaim respect and acceptance lost by the very brash and ostentatious 1980's. This process began in earnest first with masculine fragrances as male \"powerhouse\" scents were often the most bizarre and virile, while female-marketed scents were no less loud but commanding in a more charismatic way than by brute force, so they didn't transition into the \"fresh revolution\" until later on. Calvin Klein is much to blame for this entire changing of the guard, as they were among the vanguard of perfumers offering a new generation of unassuming olfactory pleasantness, but kept going further and further in that direction by using increasing numbers of nondescript custom synthetics (often with fantastic names in the note pyramids) until their perfumes smelled like nothing recognizable in the real world. Removing nature from perfume was relatively easy, as enough blending can achieve that even without synthetics, but the next step in Calvin Klein's efforts to \"smell like nothing\" would be to remove gender as well, which led to the creation of cK One in 1994. Now to be clear, unisex fragrances actually predate all other kinds of perfume, as fragrances did not have gender, despite being favored mostly by women in western culture for centuries, and only received sexual assignment after insecure guys made it clear they needed their own special scents with reassurance of masculinity if they were to wear any fragrance at all. Many niche and high-end perfume houses have never really taken to labeling their creations by gender until exclusive \"for men\" fragrances came about, and some still don't assign gender even to this day. However, in regards to mainstream perfume, Calvin Klein deliberately marketing cK One as \"unisex\" by design became a huge deal and mind-blower to those who didn't know better. The \"Age of Eternity\" was in full-swing by the advant of cK One, and it's \"One for All\" attitude spawned a wave of unisex clones from other houses throughout the decade, plus created a cult following that to this day buys up every flanker and seasonal alternate version released. Alberto Morillas, who even by 1994 had an impressive portfolio of creations, was brought in by Calvin Klein to spearhead the cK One effort, with Harry Freemont, who is also known for a lot of winners in the designer segment. Together, they created a scent that is basically so intent on being gender-neutral from a perfume aesthetics perspective, that it literally comprises notes that act to neutralize each other, making the most anonymous and androgynous of beige pleasantries ever smelled at the time. cK One is constantly fighting itself in the dry down, creating a silent maelstrom of opposing forces that smell both like a dozen things you've smelled before and also none of them simultaneously. This amazing and admittedly confusing feat begins with bergamot, lemon, mandarin, pineapple, papaya, and cardamom, which is a \"we are the world\" of citrus minus maybe lime, counterbalanced by rounder fruit choices and a meaty spice. The next level of Dante's Inferno in a bottle comes in the form of jasmine hedione, violet, rose, muguet, freesia, and nutmeg, which swings the the composition feminine from all the florals at first but soon swings the pendulum back to the guy side with nutmeg. Green tea, oakmoss, cedar, sandalwood, amber, the only synthetic \"Kleinism\" in the form of \"green tree accord\" and finally white musk bring the base into territory inhabited by unisex musk perfumes of the 1960's, without the hippie sweat factor of heavy aromatics. The conflict these accords undertake with each other is less of a free-for-all and more of a standoff a la trench warfare of the first world war. You catch a glimpse of something like citrus, then the fruit holds it in check. Violet and rose begin painting a dainty and dusty feminine picture until nutmeg stamps it out. Cedar and oakmoss begin to anchor the base in barbershop territory until the sweet amber and laundry musk neutralize the effort. The whole thing is literally just checks and balances from top to bottom, which is both exhausting to parse, and ultimately blurs into the perfume equivalent of \"apartment white\" carpeting. It goes on sweet, bright, then goes floral, and finally ends in clean musk that's hard not to like. High school teens everywhere throughout the 90's obsessed over this, thanks to pictures full of despondent 20-somethings in grungy jeans, white shirts, and edgy haircuts that plastered every subway, bus stop, airport, and magazine insert in the US. Ironically, I remember some total chauvinists back in the day refused to wear cK One because to them, a scent that was unisex was tantamount to just being women's perfume anyway, which was their loss. cK One set another precedent for Calvin Klein, who already ushered in the serenity that was Eternity for Men (1989), then came along with this scent so everyone and their sister, brother, cousin, or mother could smell clean, unobtrusive, and completely alike. I know it sounds like a fragrance trying to smell like nothing would be terrible, and for many a purist this was blasphemy, but those folks subsequently moved either into vintage scents or niche depending on their economic upward mobility anyway, leaving the designers behind to court the masses, which may have been their end game all along. Who's to say? One thing is certain, there's so much effort and creativity worked into this scent by Mr. Morillas and Freemont, plus so many nearly-imperceptible sides to cK One as a result of it's highly-synthetic blending, that it's hard not to appreciate the artistry here even from a hobbyist standpoint, if not the style of the scent itself. For those who love the puzzle box in the frosted medicine bottle that is cK One, wearings in different temperatures will reveal a great deal of versatility. Like most generalists before and after, you don't really have to think about wearing cK One, and it becomes the \"dumb-grab\" for the person in a hurry, which itself has moved more units than probably any other reason that can be found in this review. Safe and sexy in one package is the way to sell units, and designers learned from this going forward, gendered or not. The smell of cK One will yield many a compliment by men or women, as was by design, if that's something which interests you, but it is not a very distinguished nor distinguishable smell, so people wanting to be credited for their good taste are looking in the wrong place here. I find cK One to be the height of Calvin Klein's innovative perfume art through artifice approach, and although later 90's output was also nice, including the unisex sequel cK Be (1996), a certain nadir would set in by the mid-2000's that would culminate in their attempts to relearn diversity by the 2010's with mixed results. cK One is still the best of it's line to me despite being the first, because it is still the most sophisticated, well-blended, gender-neutral, and rounded of the cK scents. It's attempts at minimalism is something it's sequels achieve more successfully, at the cost of quality or true unisex appeal. I also like to think the use of cK One encourages moving outside the comfort zones and exploring other possibilities, because one thinks \"if I can wear this, what else can I do?\". It's cheap, it's pallid, and ends in a simple musk finish, but it's also quite liberating. Cheers! 27th May 2018202168IjustwannasmellgoodShow all reviewsI'd say I approached CK One with the lowest expectations possible. Judging by the reviews, it had been an overdone and highly unoriginal smell that had lost its initial glory to what came after it.I'm happy to say that isn't true in the least. CK One is a surprisingly fresh and versatile fragrance with pretty strong sillage and good longevity. The citrus-y opening with a hint of pineapple and bergamot is somewhat sweet and leads into a semi sweet floral bouquet with Jasmine and violet as it later quiets down into a soft woody accord that smells like walking fresh out of the shower.This is the perfect juice for anybody who wants to just spray and go without worrying about the smell. It's the penultimate symbol of easygoing softness and freshness that so many fragrances strive for and never quite grasp. This is the most compliments I've gotten from a fragrance.Even after all this time, CK One is a winner. Well done, Mr. Morillas. Absolutely recommended.Longevity: 6-8 hoursSillage: High 28th April 2018200781ASKJShow all reviewsI have nothing bad to say about CK One because it is so inoffensive. It's an elegant fragrance of a natural freshness in a subdued and balanced blend. It's not too sweet, not attention seeking, fresh, features natural smells, long lasting and stays close to the skin. So far so good.With that in mind, my first impression of CK One is that it belongs in the same fragrance family as laundry soap, it's a most luxurious laundry soap - but still a laundry soap. I can only speak for myself when I say I love clean smelling clothes. The kind of clothing smell which radiates a calm feeling throughout the day. Except that the fabric softener I use is much cheaper than CK one. I like CK One, I don't love it, and it's never the wrong choice of fragrance in any situation. 25th September 2017191782Brian BuchananShow all reviewscK One : that unmistakable smell of 'citrus', green tea and muguet; luminous, aloof, androgynous and hard. With its motto of 'clean is the new sexy' cK One squared the circle and became the first major puritan perfume. No mean feat : some mean 'fume. 27th August 2017266430jtdShow all reviewsA friend brought up CK One yesterday in a discussion. The Calvin Klein names sound the same to me and it only clicked which CK perfume this was when I remembered the advertising campaign. The teenage faux-grunge advertising. Oy.I'll tell you how it is that I've never smelled CK One before: target marketing works. In 1994 and I was 30, or twice the age of the target audience. I lived in New York and CK One advertising was public. In 1994, before social media, targeting simply wasn't very precise. Rather than aiming, Calvin Klein flooded. Billboards, television, magazines and newspapers, subway posters. I had to swerve to avoid it. If CK One launched today I'd simply never see it. It just wouldn't show up in any of my feeds.CK One was intended for a young audience, but the images were in everyone's face, so a sort of self-recusal took place on-by-one. The perfume appealed to you or not, depending largely on whether the story being created included you. Imagery that read as cool/aspirational to the 21 year old who found the ads exciting didn't appeal to me. Thin, world-weary teens playing Peter Pan meets Lord of the Flies? It screamed significance in fashion patois, but the post-grunge styling was years late and a shoddy attempt to cop a style from a subculture. The CK One campaign started a few months after Kurt Cobain killed himself. The notion of Calvin Klein trying to catch some momentum from grunge at this particular time was repugnant.So I opted out. I was obliged to continue to see the images–I mean, I rode the subways–but that was the end of my participation. The contempt wore off after about a week. Then I just navigated the images until the next thing came along and replaced them–a classic New York experience of my time.I remember a couple of details about the perfume. It was unisex.' I was surprised that they made a big deal of it–was unisex that novel an idea? Also, the fragrance was supposed to be contemporary and clean. SO contemporary and SO clean that it was somehow beyond scent.So I tried CK One cold' yesterday for the first time. I've never read about the perfume itself. I have a bottle of CK One and some 25 year old recollections of the launch.CK One smells like it was intended to convey hygiene yet go unnoticed. It's there, but it claims not to intrude into your consciousness. There's been years of discussion about the contradiction and denial involved in fragrances trying to smell like nothing, so I'm sure applying the notion to CK One is nothing new. But CK One smells like a very specific nothing. It's conceptual: a clean' fragrance + a masking fragrance = an impulse of purity. It allows you to feel invigorated without the invasiveness and effort of having to exhibit a clean scent. From the angle of 2017, hygienic fragrances seem very '90s-specific, but for all I know, CK One invented the approach.Of course the premise that two opposing olfactory forces will nullify each other doesn't actually work on a practical level. Instead, you're left with the remnants of a scent, like dry-cleaning chemicals that cling to your clothing. The perfume ends up locked in a cycle of constantly trying to invalidate itself. It might have been intended to be uncomplicated and undemanding, but it's no surprise that it smells like effort and tension. (Cute bottle, though.)It also smells like diet soda and Febreze, which wouldn't exist for another another 4 years. I give CK One enormous credit for its methodically synthetic tone. It comes across as calculated and legible. I had never smelled it before yesterday, and yet it instantly smelled like an era. If CK One's goal was to create a new style of fragrance, my experience points out how successful it was.from scenthurdle.com 20th July 2017189076MaddyShow all reviewsI could've sworn I reviewed this already. Since it seems that I haven't, I'll do so now.What else is there to say, but wow? Back in 2015, before my first semester at college was over, I found this at a Burlington. I had only ever used one fragrance prior to getting this, and this is what got me into the fragrance game (I now have at least a dozen fragrances).I had no idea what this would smell like, but I knew about Calvin Klein because my dad has worn two of their fragrances: eternity and obsession. I had no idea how to tell if it was a \"cologne\" or \"perfume\", but I decided to go for it. I tried it on in the car and realized that I had smelled it before. It was (and is) a very popular fragrance. Most of its users are women, but this is also a hit among younger men (like myself). I think what I smelled was a combination of musk, green tree accord, pineapple and violet. Those scents are what stick out to me. It's a very casual and relaxing scent. As another reviewer has said, it has \"90s\" written all over it. 6th July 2017188445The sent of rotten tacosShow all reviewsAhh mid 90's every guy had ck one every girl wore tommy girl. I love this smell prolly mostly because of what it reminds me of more than the actual smell. It was clutch in its prime tho! Super fresh scent just makes you wanna gel up your frosted tips, throw on your favorite pair of silvertabs, some addidas superstars! 2nd January 2017180958Kaizen1972Show all reviewsAmazing how Calvin Klein managed to have green tree accord at every level of the fragrance triangle in cK one. It's a living legend of a scent, controversial and an acquired taste.Wearing it, I feel sensations of confidence (no doubt from the citrus notes) and comfort. It's a head turner that still sticks out after all these years.I haven't tried to explore the dizzying array of cK One flankers that have come out since the original came out in 1994 - and I won't knock them until I try them. But cK One is one to check out, man or woman. 24th December 2016180510Shifty BatShow all reviewsI actually grew to enjoy One after owning a mini for several years. Surely it is synthetic and a little crowded, but it is refreshing and unisex, which is exactly what it claimed to be, and I like that. Perhaps it's the changing climes and trends making masculine florals so rare which changed my mind on this one, but I really like lily of the valley in fragrances, and to me, it is the most prominent part of One's composition. If the base wasn't so blurred and fake smelling this might have crossed the line from good to great. Edit: The line has been crossed. I have finally acquired a vintage bottle and am happy to report that it is warmer, more natural-smelling, and that the sourness of the opening is more like aldehydes than chemical tartness derived from added citruses, and the nutmeg is actually noticeable. Admittedly, the difference in vintages is a small gap, and the current formulation is still far more enjoyable than most designer releases over the last two decades, but that little difference in texture and authenticity bridged the gap for me. 11th September 2016181371cake-loveShow all reviewsI love it. I was a little too young to have worn it when it was in fashion, and probably would've hated it, anyway. Now I love it, a kind of techno-citrus that screams a kind of otherworldly calm. Like it would be saying \"relax, it's the 90s\" if it cared to speak, but instead it just gives a smug look to everyone it saunters past walking down the street back to its translucent plastic spaceship. 11th July 2016174335TheonGreyjoyShow all reviewsIt's light, not too feminine, and unoffensive. I've kept it around for years, and still enjoy wearing it to work, where it doesn't sweat off. Something doesn't have to be the end-all and be-all of cutting-edge perfumes to we worth a buy and a wear. I enjoy it! 7th July 2016174175paulanchetaShow all reviewsThis was one of the go-to fragrances for very young urban professionals (like me) back in the nineties. It ruled an era when aquatic scents took everyone to the middle of the fragrance sea. 28th February 2016168845meliscentShow all reviewsI did not wear this scent in the '90s, as it was too trendy. Two decades later, I really enjoy CK1 -- especially for everyday wear, to the office. It is clean yet not astringent like many water-inspired scents. With my body chemistry, CK1 takes on a slightly floral, powdery, feminine tone. It is not a sexy scent on me, nor it does it inspire a sense of adventure. But I select this scent when I want to feel fresh, professional, and feminine. I realize that CK1 is famous for being the first gender-neutral fragrance; but it smells feminine (floral/powdery) with my body chemistry. 5th January 2016166446Le_Coeur_GothiqueShow all reviewsOne to shine...Since I'm good in crafts, I'm thinking of making a belt with two holsters, all Far West and stuff, and pack two 200ml bottles of this little wunderwaffe all the time. Cause this looker is a life saver in all its salience. And a delight savourer in all its clarity too. It carries an one of a kind charisma to dissipate any troubles that may be thrown your way.Traffic jam? Spray some!Boring chore? Spray galore!Dulled desires?Galling quagmires?Psychic vampires?Spray some more!There's nothing this beaut can't handle. Even getting the \"poet\" out of me. Even enjoying its own bipolarity by being two different fragrances, depending on where you spray it. Citrusy and musky clouds on my wrist, salty bitter woods in the crook of my elbow (whilst crooking it).It almost changed my attitude towards Calvin Klein, since I never thought of them as a truly memorable perfume house producing fragrances with the potential to become legendary over time. Who knows, perhaps they were never meant to concoct august heavy hitters, but rather sanguine and happy carefree vagrants.Oh, and its bottle makes an excellent atypical and kooky case of a hip flask when empty.Cheers! 30th November 2015164881clamnoleShow all reviewsI bought CK One when it first came out because it seemed to me to be cutting edge at the time of the newly popular fresh scents that were hitting the market in the 90's. It didn't disappoint, I loved wearing it to casual dinners or afternoon sports events. In fact, I think I kept it in my locker at my country club for most of the time I owned it.I still like the scent today, but it's not one I want to own again. I'm older and it doesn't feel or smell right for me anymore.Great fragrance for a young man IMO, and definately a winner for Calvin Klein and Co. 13th February 2015151819Sago PalmShow all reviewsI'm quite fond of this fragrance. My sister's signature fragrance, and I associate it with her and her home, lots of fun times with her during some special chapters in our lives. It's fresh and clean, slightly citrus-y and in a word, \"pleasant\".I recognize it occasionally when out and about, as it's noticeable on others, but not loud. A colleague of mine also wore it and I'd compliment her often on her fragrance choice. It leaves a homey trail when the wearer passes, always making me smile. When I moved on from that place of work, she gifted me with a bottle to remind me of her, which I still use occasionally. It's very comforting and was such a sweet memento. 18th October 2014147471NOiDONThaveBOShow all reviewsI think this is great. There is a feeling to it that I find similar to M.I. by Creed and it can be had for so cheap. I had one of those super cheap \"our version of\" knock-off bottles when I was a young teenager, but I bought a legit bottle last year and the smell is delightful: fruity and floral with just the right amount of territory-marking musk. 22nd August 2014145403zombonieShow all reviewsVery similar to Penhaligon's Quercus, this is a fresh unisex scent. It is the 1990s in a bottle. 29th July 2014144440dark phoenix 123Show all reviewsi remember i did not like it initially (to the extent of trying to wash it off after a sales girl sprayed it on my arm). But subsequently, someone I admired used it and somehow i warmed up to the smell and found it irresistable since. i have hoarded quite a few vintage bottles (including a super huge bottle) as I find they smell and last much better than the current ones.

The perfect blend between floral, sweet and clean they have achieved a master piece in the floral oriental category.

To me it's more of an after-shower refresher (not unlike 4711, which famously marketed itself as \"the refreshant cologne\" for many years). On my skin it's barely detectable after ten minutes --- which is fine, because then I can apply a real fragrance with some staying power, if I'm so inclined.As a fragrance, it's too bland and unobjectionable to dislike. To paraphrase Gertrude Stein, \"there's no 'there' there.\" On a hot day or after a shower --- sure, but again, it doesn't last, and doesn't really smell like anything except a generic \"fresh\" for a few minutes. 6th June 2022260123FSOCI3TYShow all reviewsFor the price, it's pretty good. However, the Lily of the Valley note didn't really impress me, so I sold the bottle soon after purchasing it. Green and slightly powdery, with some generic citruses to keep it bright. It's light so respray it as often as needed.It's just boring. Perhaps this brings nostalgic memories for those growing up in the 1990s. It's definitely not a bad scent, but it didn't really live up to its hype. It's more of an expectation mismanagement that's to blame. 10th March 2022256037ADVERTISEMENTBrissoShow all reviewsOne third Z 14, one third Tuscany, one third CK One.

Nothing special.Personally, I think this is great to wear before bed or while hanging out at home. Keeps you smelling nice without killing your revenue. 21st October 201199531DutchSchwagShow all reviewsCalvin Klein was always about two things in the 1990´s, at least in the fragrance realm, and both of those were inter-related. Packaging and marketing, with packaging an extension of the Bauhaus minimalism meets 1990´s existentialist faux-artsy commercials being crafted to coalesce into a middle-class neo-riche.This stuff is beautifully packaged, the elixir jar another one of Klein´s subtle but smart campaigns of simplicity implying sophistication and class. But ultimately things come down to quality and substance, though CK One may have been groundbreaking in its reach and stretch and in the colognes that soon followed, CK One does not seem to stand out all that particularly well against its proteges these days. In fact, to be blunt, the reformulation smells quite cheap and uninspired. That doesn't mean it always was, because at its top, the lemon citrus bite and floral accords that rise to the surface shortly after the opening do have a certain charm and unique blending, especially given its time period. This seems better as a nice every-day skin soother rather than a reliable cologne. Longevity on this is somewhat tame, 3-4 hours can even be quite ambitious and unattainable. That must be why the reformulation comes in such massive quantity. The notes themselves are a creative blending of citrus, floral and tea, with jasmine seeming to standout in what might constitute as a bit of a mess, but a nice mess all the same. It certainly helped open the door for the success of Acqua di Gio and many other aquatic based fragrances and for that a certain respectability has to be given, but overall, CK One is simply nothing too exceptional to seek out beyond wanting to pay homage to a historical trendsetter or as an after-shower body after shave for the soul. Weak longevity and maybe a bit above average projection for an aquatic, but expires far too quickly for its price-tag. A refreshing musky background persists all the way through which seems to work with the other ingredients. A bit daft and ordinary in a modern sense, but that's only because CK One's incarnation itself helped lead the way to more open doors in the fragrance market. For that reason, should be respected, but nothing to seek out for its own sake as a head-turn. The reformulation leans more towards the synthetic and floral. 16th March 201187251alfaromShow all reviewsThis review is to talk about all of the Calvin Klein classics (one / be /obession / escape / eternity etc. etc.). A bunch of them were ok, a few of them even good, but a lot of them were just perfumed water for ironing with the CK monogram on the bottle. The problem, thou, it's not with the perfumes themselves but instead with the fact that in a certain period almost everybody was wearing a CK creation. I can say I never tried one of these scent personally but instead I passively suffered them all. I started to develope an allergy and grew it in the years. What I can say for sure is, sooo bad for me, they had an incredible commercial feedback. I will survive! 5th March 201186360DarvantShow all reviewsI tend to admire the usage of tea in the olfactory universe This is basically a scent grounded over tea where a fresh dominant tea note drags some fruits and flowers towards a musky and ambery base. A complex blast of citric elements, fruits and nocturnal flowers dominates the top and the middle notes while a tea note links it to a musky, amber drydown. I detect some Paco's trait and a touch of Bvlgari classic Pour Homme based over gree tea. The feminine trait of this unisex marketed fragrance is grounded by floral notes as lily, violet, jasmine and rose even CK One is masculine to me. I apreciate the invigorating effect from tea and the fresh, herbal, musky, nocturnal trait. A bit too fruity for my taste. Quite decent fragrance anyway. 22nd January 2011133775Relent de ChevalerieShow all reviewsOddly enough, I was never made aware this fragrance was aimed for unisex marketing until I read reviews on this site. In fact, I wore it long ago because CK was becoming popular around me and we all thought it was the cool, masculine thing to do. Was it the fact it was something of a non-threatening male kind of accord manly yet sensitive- that was so appealing to us youngsters back then? I can't really say. One thing for sure, I had just been heartbroken by someone wearing Obsession and couldn't find it in me to wear that one again. Leaving me, she had thrown me back to square one. I needed to find some new hope that love was out there; that someone, somewhere, waited for me to meet her. I eventually became enrapt by spiritualism and stopped wearing it. The fact that a lot of people around me ended up wearing it might have also influenced my choice to opt for something else, I think. What I could remember of it was that it had a pleasant citrus glow to it. Revisiting the past and stimulated by the reviews on basenotes, I wore it again not too long ago. I would say I find it to be an interesting one. Realizing online that it was meant as a unisex scent, it now seems to me to have become much more popular amongst men than it has amongst women. Was it that the non-threatening male was becoming en vogue back then but the feminine models such as Nikita and the subsequent others had yet to make their appearances? I can't say.My socio-cultural musings put aside, CK One comes off, at first, as citrus and a green something… like… fougère, I'd say. I don't get the pineapple and, if I search for it, just a bit of the papaya. The accord presents itself more like citrus and green to me. It does, especially, if I just try to get a general gist of it. Its core notes feel more floral and I get a jasmine, nutmeg and a green something that isn't really fougère anymore. Violet and rose? No, not really. The musk and amber/green in the base notes that I perceive, when it's reached its drydown, I have to say, are quite nice too. It all boils down to a nice fragrance, especially since its popularity has faded and that I'm living in China where it's not so well known. Also, the fact it now has memories attached to it must surely help. 17th January 201075140RedbeardShow all reviews(Writing side-by-side with Eternity) Starts out as a lemony aquatic, and reasonably strong. I'm really impressed with the top, as it does the \"fresh and clean, laundry and shower\" thing in such a captivating way compared to others of its type, albeit slightly synthetic. Is there maybe even a little tea, or at least Synth-O-Tea? There's enough of that, or something herbal, to keep it from being as \"perfumey\" and sweet as Eternity, even though I find it stronger. It starts to get a little musky over time, retaining a sharp element if you breathe it deeply. At this point, I realize that it's starting to turn into Ass-Leather, that basenote of cheap aquatics that always feels so contrived to me, so I'm a bit let down. Plus something licoricey develops, which really puts me off.

This cologne is so light it's like goose down, it's almost weightless. As in invisible. On me I can barely detect a trace of it after just a few minutes.On the positive side, it has a very fresh smell when it goes on. That flattens out in a hurry to a kind of inobtrusive, unobjectionable aroma that is kind of attractive, though it does not smell like anything that occurs naturally.I can't recognize a single one of the Top, Middle, or Base notes. If I were flat out guessing, I'd be aiming at imaginary chemicals, like extract of ammonium hydrate, essence of fluorocarbon, natural ozone, etc.I kind of like it, in a post-modern kind of way, for the full 15 minutes it lasts. 2nd June 200967020Kabamaru ninjaShow all reviewsThis scent to me is under the average very flowery and too much \"happy\"to me.Its a classic after all this succeeded years and but if it wasn't I d saythat it is a thump down one! 29th September 20086132312 Next Most reviews in the last weekmanlyscents (8)Colbourne (8)Varanis Ridari (4)exmin (3)landshark321 (3)RoamingRose (3)speedracer (3)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)sakecat (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (27)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (8)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Lian (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

The opening is somewhat like a traditional cologne tempered with harsh synthetics and fermenting fruits. Carries a light, musky, fresh base. I pass on this one. Try it at Macy's if you haven't already. 14th November 200942576MOONBShow all reviewsI gave this a try, once or twice.Look, the thing is I don't think you can expect too much from a CK fragrance. And my expectations were pretty low when I tried this. Please keep in mind, I'm 27 now, and I think it was only a year or two ago that I gave CK One a chance. So I don't think I'm the right age, or even the marketers' target age for this smell.I find this to be far too sweet-smelling, and far too synthetic. I know it's supposed to be unisex, but that's odd, because I don't find anything about randomly combining summer fruits and florals to be either masculine or feminine. It all just seems a bit youthful and childish, and carries itself that way - albeit boldly - which doesn't say much to favor it. Like almost everything else that came out of the '90s, this is contrived and sub-par. unless you're between the ages of 14 - 18, I'd avoid CK One and wear something that smells better. 5th November 200973841pinkfizzyShow all reviewsSmells like pineapple juice and citrus dishsoap and cheap musks.

        "All reviews": "Show all reviewsI don't actually consider CK One to be a fragrance. To me it's more of an after-shower refresher (not unlike 4711, which famously marketed itself as \"the refreshant cologne\" for many years). On my skin it's barely detectable after ten minutes --- which is fine, because then I can apply a real fragrance with some staying power, if I'm so inclined.As a fragrance, it's too bland and unobjectionable to dislike. To paraphrase Gertrude Stein, \"there's no 'there' there.\" On a hot day or after a shower --- sure, but again, it doesn't last, and doesn't really smell like anything except a generic \"fresh\" for a few minutes. 6th June 2022260123SpicemeisterShow all reviewsIt smells good. A balance of what seems like white florals, some citrus/fruit, some light wood, and slight musk, though I can't really pick out any individual notes. A little powdery and clean but not soapy or musty. Soft and comforting; cohesive and well-balanced; atmospheric. Despite some reviews that say \"synthetic\", fairly natural smelling for me. Unisex and somewhat indistinctive, but also inoffensive. Moderate longevity. On me it doesn't project much/stays close to the skin.That said, I don't know if I'll be wearing it too much, as I prefer scents that make more of a statement, are stronger, or have prominent notes--more character, and frankly, more masculine. 24th April 2022258168ADVERTISEMENTFSOCI3TYShow all reviewsFor the price, it's pretty good. However, the Lily of the Valley note didn't really impress me, so I sold the bottle soon after purchasing it. Green and slightly powdery, with some generic citruses to keep it bright. It's light so respray it as often as needed.It's just boring. Perhaps this brings nostalgic memories for those growing up in the 1990s. It's definitely not a bad scent, but it didn't really live up to its hype. It's more of an expectation mismanagement that's to blame. 10th March 2022256037Jon_RemyShow all reviewsThis came out in 1989, not 1994. I was on a plane to Munich when another passenger said she worked for the Calvin Klein company and was incidentally carrying a sample of CK One in her purse, which she gave to me. She said it was a unisex fragrance (something new at the time). I thanked her, and have loved CK One ever since 1989. 16th April 2021241687Ne Plus UltraShow all reviewsAs far as fragrances that were released during the 90s (I'm not including frags released in the late 80s; like Cool Water, Joop, or CK's Eternity in this one) there were a handful of fragrances that achieved ubiquitousness in an era they were made in - Calvin Klein's One, being one (no pun intended) of them. In fact, I think the only other fragrance that beats CK One as a time capsule of the 1990s is: Acqua di Giò.Like Acqua di Giò, this scent was everywhere in the 90s. Probably even more so, because it was (as it is now) cheaper than Acqua di Giò.Disclaimer: this review might be a little biased due in part to nostalgia. Smelling this fragrance again; I can hear Ace of Base's \"The Sign\" bouncing along in the overhead speakers while walking around in the mall when I was a kid.I don't know how long past formulations lasted. But, in it's current form; 6 hours, at best.First notes to greet the nose; is a lemon/citrus smell, very comparable to a gin & tonic smell. Accompanying the slighty boozy citrus smell is a vaguely synthetic smelling floral scent - think of roses or tulips. There's also a very subtle feminine tone underlying the floral/citrus/fresh smells; to me, it reminds me of a women's salon shampoo.Projection lasts about an hour. After that, the citrus notes taper off, and the floral scent plateaus.Hour 3-4: the citrus takes a back seat to the green tea and sandalwood. By this point, it is a fresh/floral scent.Hour 4-5: Basically, a skin scent at this point. Citrus smell is mostly gone.Hour 6: Whatever sillage left on the skin, has evaporated or been absorbed, by this point. Any residual smell left, now lingers on your clothes; your shirt will smell vaguely of dryer sheets.And that's about it; It's neither very remarkable, nor very bad. It's just...your basic, safe, clean, inoffensive (for the most part), scent...and, that's part of the problem with it.CK One suffers from a couple of problems: 1. It's a people-pleasing fragrance from Calvin Klein; so it's going to be a somewhat of a milquetoast, synthetic, middle of the road fragrance to some people - especially after 25+ years of being on the market.2. It's a unisex fragrance; it ends up straddling a fence between feminine/masculine which makes it smell more generic than it otherwise would have.3. It could end up being either too masculine or too feminine on you; depending on your body chemistry and what sex you are. On me, I find it to be a little on the feminine side within the first hour: it's the floral scent mixed with women's haircare product smell. To me, this is a daytime scent; wear this at the office or casual weekend afternoons. Technically, this might be considered an \"all-season\" fragrance. But, I would classify it as a spring/summertime scent. Again, it's just a workhorse fragrance for the office or running errands on a spring/summer day below 75°.I would recommend this people who are new to fragrances, and basically want a cheap, inoffensive, safe scent they can use everyday.3.25/5 stars. Just barely above a neutral rating for me. 18th March 2021241812BrissoShow all reviewsOne third Z 14, one third Tuscany, one third CK One. Hello Aussie summer!! 27th October 2020235221AbbissShow all reviewsThis review is going to be a bit contradictory. So was the fragrance. I shared my boyfriend's bottle when I was 18 and he was 38. That's 13 years ago. I still have the memories of a fresh fragrance with citrus and woods, that I found cool in my pseudo-feminist young and free years, but also too masculine for what I was thinking I should smell like. It felt like the notes were chosen to balance each other, to the point of zero, like opposite-coloured lights would make the sum of them look white. 27th October 2018208605seeroos.syedShow all reviewsThis smells almost identical to Azzaro's Chrome, and al-Rehab's Silver. Ok but not great.3.5/5 4th July 2018203730Varanis RidariShow all reviewsReviewing generalist scents always brings up the problem of not only setting the facts strait amongst all the unintelligible and extreme two-liner reviews that either skyrocket or tank the scent's ratings, but also of accurately describing them with enough specifics to make them seem distinct to the reader without smelling them, since generalists are not meant to be distinct by their nature, with cK One (1994) being the ultimate generalist. The hot take version of this review is cK One is essentially an Alyssa Ashley Musk (1968) 2.0, but for more, read on. The mass-appeal fragrance model always existed but not until the 90's did it cast such an impossibly wide net, with new creations resetting all the levels on things from the past and striving to be as inoffensive and unspecific as possible, in an attempt to reclaim respect and acceptance lost by the very brash and ostentatious 1980's. This process began in earnest first with masculine fragrances as male \"powerhouse\" scents were often the most bizarre and virile, while female-marketed scents were no less loud but commanding in a more charismatic way than by brute force, so they didn't transition into the \"fresh revolution\" until later on. Calvin Klein is much to blame for this entire changing of the guard, as they were among the vanguard of perfumers offering a new generation of unassuming olfactory pleasantness, but kept going further and further in that direction by using increasing numbers of nondescript custom synthetics (often with fantastic names in the note pyramids) until their perfumes smelled like nothing recognizable in the real world. Removing nature from perfume was relatively easy, as enough blending can achieve that even without synthetics, but the next step in Calvin Klein's efforts to \"smell like nothing\" would be to remove gender as well, which led to the creation of cK One in 1994. Now to be clear, unisex fragrances actually predate all other kinds of perfume, as fragrances did not have gender, despite being favored mostly by women in western culture for centuries, and only received sexual assignment after insecure guys made it clear they needed their own special scents with reassurance of masculinity if they were to wear any fragrance at all. Many niche and high-end perfume houses have never really taken to labeling their creations by gender until exclusive \"for men\" fragrances came about, and some still don't assign gender even to this day. However, in regards to mainstream perfume, Calvin Klein deliberately marketing cK One as \"unisex\" by design became a huge deal and mind-blower to those who didn't know better. The \"Age of Eternity\" was in full-swing by the advant of cK One, and it's \"One for All\" attitude spawned a wave of unisex clones from other houses throughout the decade, plus created a cult following that to this day buys up every flanker and seasonal alternate version released. Alberto Morillas, who even by 1994 had an impressive portfolio of creations, was brought in by Calvin Klein to spearhead the cK One effort, with Harry Freemont, who is also known for a lot of winners in the designer segment. Together, they created a scent that is basically so intent on being gender-neutral from a perfume aesthetics perspective, that it literally comprises notes that act to neutralize each other, making the most anonymous and androgynous of beige pleasantries ever smelled at the time. cK One is constantly fighting itself in the dry down, creating a silent maelstrom of opposing forces that smell both like a dozen things you've smelled before and also none of them simultaneously. This amazing and admittedly confusing feat begins with bergamot, lemon, mandarin, pineapple, papaya, and cardamom, which is a \"we are the world\" of citrus minus maybe lime, counterbalanced by rounder fruit choices and a meaty spice. The next level of Dante's Inferno in a bottle comes in the form of jasmine hedione, violet, rose, muguet, freesia, and nutmeg, which swings the the composition feminine from all the florals at first but soon swings the pendulum back to the guy side with nutmeg. Green tea, oakmoss, cedar, sandalwood, amber, the only synthetic \"Kleinism\" in the form of \"green tree accord\" and finally white musk bring the base into territory inhabited by unisex musk perfumes of the 1960's, without the hippie sweat factor of heavy aromatics. The conflict these accords undertake with each other is less of a free-for-all and more of a standoff a la trench warfare of the first world war. You catch a glimpse of something like citrus, then the fruit holds it in check. Violet and rose begin painting a dainty and dusty feminine picture until nutmeg stamps it out. Cedar and oakmoss begin to anchor the base in barbershop territory until the sweet amber and laundry musk neutralize the effort. The whole thing is literally just checks and balances from top to bottom, which is both exhausting to parse, and ultimately blurs into the perfume equivalent of \"apartment white\" carpeting. It goes on sweet, bright, then goes floral, and finally ends in clean musk that's hard not to like. High school teens everywhere throughout the 90's obsessed over this, thanks to pictures full of despondent 20-somethings in grungy jeans, white shirts, and edgy haircuts that plastered every subway, bus stop, airport, and magazine insert in the US. Ironically, I remember some total chauvinists back in the day refused to wear cK One because to them, a scent that was unisex was tantamount to just being women's perfume anyway, which was their loss. cK One set another precedent for Calvin Klein, who already ushered in the serenity that was Eternity for Men (1989), then came along with this scent so everyone and their sister, brother, cousin, or mother could smell clean, unobtrusive, and completely alike. I know it sounds like a fragrance trying to smell like nothing would be terrible, and for many a purist this was blasphemy, but those folks subsequently moved either into vintage scents or niche depending on their economic upward mobility anyway, leaving the designers behind to court the masses, which may have been their end game all along. Who's to say? One thing is certain, there's so much effort and creativity worked into this scent by Mr. Morillas and Freemont, plus so many nearly-imperceptible sides to cK One as a result of it's highly-synthetic blending, that it's hard not to appreciate the artistry here even from a hobbyist standpoint, if not the style of the scent itself. For those who love the puzzle box in the frosted medicine bottle that is cK One, wearings in different temperatures will reveal a great deal of versatility. Like most generalists before and after, you don't really have to think about wearing cK One, and it becomes the \"dumb-grab\" for the person in a hurry, which itself has moved more units than probably any other reason that can be found in this review. Safe and sexy in one package is the way to sell units, and designers learned from this going forward, gendered or not. The smell of cK One will yield many a compliment by men or women, as was by design, if that's something which interests you, but it is not a very distinguished nor distinguishable smell, so people wanting to be credited for their good taste are looking in the wrong place here. I find cK One to be the height of Calvin Klein's innovative perfume art through artifice approach, and although later 90's output was also nice, including the unisex sequel cK Be (1996), a certain nadir would set in by the mid-2000's that would culminate in their attempts to relearn diversity by the 2010's with mixed results. cK One is still the best of it's line to me despite being the first, because it is still the most sophisticated, well-blended, gender-neutral, and rounded of the cK scents. It's attempts at minimalism is something it's sequels achieve more successfully, at the cost of quality or true unisex appeal. I also like to think the use of cK One encourages moving outside the comfort zones and exploring other possibilities, because one thinks \"if I can wear this, what else can I do?\". It's cheap, it's pallid, and ends in a simple musk finish, but it's also quite liberating. Cheers! 27th May 2018202168IjustwannasmellgoodShow all reviewsI'd say I approached CK One with the lowest expectations possible. Judging by the reviews, it had been an overdone and highly unoriginal smell that had lost its initial glory to what came after it.I'm happy to say that isn't true in the least. CK One is a surprisingly fresh and versatile fragrance with pretty strong sillage and good longevity. The citrus-y opening with a hint of pineapple and bergamot is somewhat sweet and leads into a semi sweet floral bouquet with Jasmine and violet as it later quiets down into a soft woody accord that smells like walking fresh out of the shower.This is the perfect juice for anybody who wants to just spray and go without worrying about the smell. It's the penultimate symbol of easygoing softness and freshness that so many fragrances strive for and never quite grasp. This is the most compliments I've gotten from a fragrance.Even after all this time, CK One is a winner. Well done, Mr. Morillas. Absolutely recommended.Longevity: 6-8 hoursSillage: High 28th April 2018200781tenaedivionnisShow all reviewsTAKE IT FROM ME:The cologne smells OK, but whatever ingredients companies use for Women's Purfume, You will smell that in \"The One\" 31st March 2018199661Mel BShow all reviewsI have just recently finished a bottle of CK One that I have had for quite some time.

It's an elegant fragrance of a natural freshness in a subdued and balanced blend. It's not too sweet, not attention seeking, fresh, features natural smells, long lasting and stays close to the skin. So far so good.With that in mind, my first impression of CK One is that it belongs in the same fragrance family as laundry soap, it's a most luxurious laundry soap - but still a laundry soap. I can only speak for myself when I say I love clean smelling clothes. The kind of clothing smell which radiates a calm feeling throughout the day. Except that the fabric softener I use is much cheaper than CK one. I like CK One, I don't love it, and it's never the wrong choice of fragrance in any situation. 25th September 2017191782Brian BuchananShow all reviewscK One : that unmistakable smell of 'citrus', green tea and muguet; luminous, aloof, androgynous and hard.

The Calvin Klein names sound the same to me and it only clicked which CK perfume this was when I remembered the advertising campaign. The teenage faux-grunge advertising. Oy.I'll tell you how it is that I've never smelled CK One before: target marketing works. In 1994 and I was 30, or twice the age of the target audience. I lived in New York and CK One advertising was public. In 1994, before social media, targeting simply wasn't very precise. Rather than aiming, Calvin Klein flooded. Billboards, television, magazines and newspapers, subway posters. I had to swerve to avoid it. If CK One launched today I'd simply never see it. It just wouldn't show up in any of my feeds.CK One was intended for a young audience, but the images were in everyone's face, so a sort of self-recusal took place on-by-one. The perfume appealed to you or not, depending largely on whether the story being created included you. Imagery that read as cool/aspirational to the 21 year old who found the ads exciting didn't appeal to me. Thin, world-weary teens playing Peter Pan meets Lord of the Flies? It screamed significance in fashion patois, but the post-grunge styling was years late and a shoddy attempt to cop a style from a subculture. The CK One campaign started a few months after Kurt Cobain killed himself. The notion of Calvin Klein trying to catch some momentum from grunge at this particular time was repugnant.So I opted out. I was obliged to continue to see the images–I mean, I rode the subways–but that was the end of my participation. The contempt wore off after about a week. Then I just navigated the images until the next thing came along and replaced them–a classic New York experience of my time.I remember a couple of details about the perfume. It was unisex.' I was surprised that they made a big deal of it–was unisex that novel an idea? Also, the fragrance was supposed to be contemporary and clean. SO contemporary and SO clean that it was somehow beyond scent.So I tried CK One cold' yesterday for the first time. I've never read about the perfume itself. I have a bottle of CK One and some 25 year old recollections of the launch.CK One smells like it was intended to convey hygiene yet go unnoticed. It's there, but it claims not to intrude into your consciousness. There's been years of discussion about the contradiction and denial involved in fragrances trying to smell like nothing, so I'm sure applying the notion to CK One is nothing new. But CK One smells like a very specific nothing. It's conceptual: a clean' fragrance + a masking fragrance = an impulse of purity. It allows you to feel invigorated without the invasiveness and effort of having to exhibit a clean scent. From the angle of 2017, hygienic fragrances seem very '90s-specific, but for all I know, CK One invented the approach.Of course the premise that two opposing olfactory forces will nullify each other doesn't actually work on a practical level. Instead, you're left with the remnants of a scent, like dry-cleaning chemicals that cling to your clothing. The perfume ends up locked in a cycle of constantly trying to invalidate itself. It might have been intended to be uncomplicated and undemanding, but it's no surprise that it smells like effort and tension. (Cute bottle, though.)It also smells like diet soda and Febreze, which wouldn't exist for another another 4 years. I give CK One enormous credit for its methodically synthetic tone. It comes across as calculated and legible. I had never smelled it before yesterday, and yet it instantly smelled like an era. If CK One's goal was to create a new style of fragrance, my experience points out how successful it was.from scenthurdle.com 20th July 2017189076MaddyShow all reviewsI could've sworn I reviewed this already. Since it seems that I haven't, I'll do so now.What else is there to say, but wow? Back in 2015, before my first semester at college was over, I found this at a Burlington. I had only ever used one fragrance prior to getting this, and this is what got me into the fragrance game (I now have at least a dozen fragrances).I had no idea what this would smell like, but I knew about Calvin Klein because my dad has worn two of their fragrances: eternity and obsession. I had no idea how to tell if it was a \"cologne\" or \"perfume\", but I decided to go for it. I tried it on in the car and realized that I had smelled it before. It was (and is) a very popular fragrance. Most of its users are women, but this is also a hit among younger men (like myself). I think what I smelled was a combination of musk, green tree accord, pineapple and violet. Those scents are what stick out to me. It's a very casual and relaxing scent. As another reviewer has said, it has \"90s\" written all over it. 6th July 2017188445vinaccioShow all reviewsA really good scent, very crowdpleasing.Sadly overused and thus not a real compliment getter anymore (I enjoy wearing parfume, I enjoy them a lot more when I can get compliments from them!). 19th March 2017184224The sent of rotten tacosShow all reviewsAhh mid 90's every guy had ck one every girl wore tommy girl. I love this smell prolly mostly because of what it reminds me of more than the actual smell. It was clutch in its prime tho! Super fresh scent just makes you wanna gel up your frosted tips, throw on your favorite pair of silvertabs, some addidas superstars! 2nd January 2017180958Kaizen1972Show all reviewsAmazing how Calvin Klein managed to have green tree accord at every level of the fragrance triangle in cK one. It's a living legend of a scent, controversial and an acquired taste.Wearing it, I feel sensations of confidence (no doubt from the citrus notes) and comfort. It's a head turner that still sticks out after all these years.I haven't tried to explore the dizzying array of cK One flankers that have come out since the original came out in 1994 - and I won't knock them until I try them. But cK One is one to check out, man or woman. 24th December 2016180510Shifty BatShow all reviewsI actually grew to enjoy One after owning a mini for several years. Surely it is synthetic and a little crowded, but it is refreshing and unisex, which is exactly what it claimed to be, and I like that. Perhaps it's the changing climes and trends making masculine florals so rare which changed my mind on this one, but I really like lily of the valley in fragrances, and to me, it is the most prominent part of One's composition. If the base wasn't so blurred and fake smelling this might have crossed the line from good to great. Edit: The line has been crossed. I have finally acquired a vintage bottle and am happy to report that it is warmer, more natural-smelling, and that the sourness of the opening is more like aldehydes than chemical tartness derived from added citruses, and the nutmeg is actually noticeable. Admittedly, the difference in vintages is a small gap, and the current formulation is still far more enjoyable than most designer releases over the last two decades, but that little difference in texture and authenticity bridged the gap for me. 11th September 2016181371cake-loveShow all reviewsI love it. I was a little too young to have worn it when it was in fashion, and probably would've hated it, anyway. Now I love it, a kind of techno-citrus that screams a kind of otherworldly calm. Like it would be saying \"relax, it's the 90s\" if it cared to speak, but instead it just gives a smug look to everyone it saunters past walking down the street back to its translucent plastic spaceship. 11th July 2016174335TheonGreyjoyShow all reviewsIt's light, not too feminine, and unoffensive. I've kept it around for years, and still enjoy wearing it to work, where it doesn't sweat off. Something doesn't have to be the end-all and be-all of cutting-edge perfumes to we worth a buy and a wear. I enjoy it! 7th July 2016174175paulanchetaShow all reviewsThis was one of the go-to fragrances for very young urban professionals (like me) back in the nineties. It ruled an era when aquatic scents took everyone to the middle of the fragrance sea. 28th February 2016168845meliscentShow all reviewsI did not wear this scent in the '90s, as it was too trendy. Two decades later, I really enjoy CK1 -- especially for everyday wear, to the office. It is clean yet not astringent like many water-inspired scents. With my body chemistry, CK1 takes on a slightly floral, powdery, feminine tone. It is not a sexy scent on me, nor it does it inspire a sense of adventure. But I select this scent when I want to feel fresh, professional, and feminine. I realize that CK1 is famous for being the first gender-neutral fragrance; but it smells feminine (floral/powdery) with my body chemistry. 5th January 2016166446123  567 Next Most reviews in the last weekColbourne (8)manlyscents (8)Varanis Ridari (4)exmin (3)landshark321 (3)RoamingRose (3)speedracer (3)Funwithfrags (3)Darvant (3)epapsiou (2)Most reviews in the last monthColbourne (27)ShinningLightOfThunder (19)landshark321 (9)Callista25 (9)Varanis Ridari (8)Funwithfrags (8)manlyscents (8)sjg3839 (7)Zgb (7)Lian (7)Most reviews of all timerbaker (3234)Darvant (2812)foetidus (2352)speedracer (1963)SirSlarty (1910)odysseusm (1696)Varanis Ridari (1664)JackTwist (1603)rogalal (1579)gimmegreen (1559)ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT ",

        "All reviews": "Show all reviewsThis is not just a dislike, this is a full on repulsion. I do not think that this smells like Baccarat Rouge 540, however, I do have the same level of disdain for both. They both have this weird, metallic yet airy, and stabby quality to the sweetness. I don’t know what it is, my brain tells me it’s ethyl maltol… and a huge dose of it, but I don’t know if that’s true. I shouldn’t have bought it. I should have listened to those comparing it to BR540 and known that they share a quality that is not meant for me. It performs well, of course… every perfume you hate will have the best performance. 15th September 2022264251bulbulShow all reviewsThis was a gift from my brother-in-law, which I promptly re-gifted to my 10-year old daughter. A synthetic fruity scent. Heavy on the strawberry. If you want to smell like a middle-aged version of the popular Strawberry Shortcake doll, or a somewhat sophisticated tween, this is the scent for you. Otherwise, hard pass. 27th June 2022260980ADVERTISEMENTFSOCI3TYShow all reviewsThis fragrance opens with a musky raspberry vanilla scent, but it falls short as a Baccarat Rouge 540 clone. While there are some similarities in the beginning, it quickly takes a different turn and becomes a light berry-dominant fragrance. If you're specifically looking for a BR540 dupe, you may be disappointed.Instead, I would recommend checking out Al Haramain's Amber Oud Rouge as a solid alternative to BR540. 27th February 2022272690wonderland_asylumShow all reviewsI liked this! Paired with strawberry pound cake lotion from bath and body works I smell like a whole dessert! I smell the strawberry note and I love it! 9th February 2022253668tesseraShow all reviewsCitrus jasmine smelling like gardenia to me, soft, sort of vanillic. Easy to wear, pretty.

Even when it settles, its too kid-sweet, like for a very young girl. Should be a scent by Barbie. 20th November 2021249721andreamazdraShow all reviewsDidn't care for the opening but the dry down was nice. A little metallic for my taste though.

I get a grape kool-aid opening but it fades quickly then just deep dark floral/musk. Very vintage feeling, assertive, human and warm. I can smell the ylang ylang, the tea notes elude me (probably for the best) and I love the drydown the most, there is still some floral in there but mostly a warm, comfortable musk. 23rd March 2023270879teardropShow all reviewsThis has a spicy-woody opening, with black pepper & perhaps some clove, lasting for a good hour before a darkly indolic jasmine comes through in the heart. This is swiftly followed by a softly animalic amber, & five hours in I detect some moss in the base. The projection is moderate to good, & eleven hours in it's still going as a skin scent.This scent purrs rather than growls. It's more of a comfort scent than a weapon of seduction, but still a lovely warm, vintage-style fragrance that works very well on cooler evenings. 27th January 2016167404ADVERTISEMENTMimi GardeniaShow all reviewsThis is so good ! Addictive ,delicious ,dark and sweet musk .it's just the rest blend of animal and warm skin. Warm fur ,a great tuberose note ,oakmoss....wow ! I love this. Very original ,sexy - a vamp fragrance. Loses that intensity and then hums along as very patchouli -amber - vanilla . Very sniffable and wearable. 2nd July 201059599SugandarajaShow all reviewsI may be the only one to smell this, but Prowl reaches my nose as an osmanthus soliflore. Bright, sunny florals, hints of tea, and a big fruity apricot combine to give this impression strongly, but here there's of a certain thickness and richness I've yet to encounter before - osmanthus fragrances have a tendency to hit my nose as thin and high-pitched, but not Prowl. Fruity-florals aren't my thing, but this hits the spot in an almost unique way; the only comparable fruity fragrance I know is the obscure AL02, a similar but much darker and more oriental composition.The drydown abruptly changes style a few hours in, leaving all this behind and becoming a very soft, pillow-like vanilla.There is nothing aggressive, threatening, or animalic about Prowl. It's a great name, and a charming fragrance, but this is more \"Ciao for now!\" than a roar. 13th May 201042291BuzzlepuffShow all reviewsPROWL reminds me of a feline animal moving with stealth through exotic florals. The notes are Black Pepper, Honeysuckle green, sambac jasmine, tuberose, over a base of oakmoss, patchouli, amber and civet. A husky animal warmth that is very sexy. The indoles of the sambac jasmine and civet in the base keeps the animal alive in this one. After an hour or so, a warm powdery huskiness emerges through the florals into the warm civet base. It is feminine in allure but coupled with a very masculine aggressiveness - a cougar is on the prowl. . .

A modern but classically inspired fragrance full of allure and mystere. Orphéon Eau de Parfum by Diptyque is (marketed as unisex but mostly masculine to me) grassy musky floral Chypré fragrance with a distinguisced, assertive and vaguely nostalgic-melancholic soul. This fragrance is classy in a measured, \"silent\" and super balanced way. Despite marketed as unisex it is a fragrance better performing on a men imo (if you really want to take the most of it), although I have to assert that there is in it a sort of sophisticated musk/ylang-ylang oriented silky subtleness you can find out in many glorious feminine perfumes of the past (Fendi by Fendi, V&A First etc, just to quote several). Orphéon Eau de Parfum was launched in 2021and the nose behind this fragrance is the great Olivier Pescheux (Ex Nihilo, D&G, Versace, Ysl, Jil Sander, Lanvin, Moschino etc). Orphéon is told to evoke the smoky and warm atmosphere of an iconic night club bar in the Saint Germain Paris neighborhood and it is named behind it. To be honest I don't get any smoky vibe while I detect a complex floral presence (definitely more than the only jasmine), musk, pepper, juniper berries, ginger and lot more. Juniper berries is probably the main element and this fragrance definitely exalts this note and its implementation in perfumery. The fragrance is mostly focused on soapy talky cedarwood (woody notes plus soothing and powdery tonka bean and fresh soapy tobacco), tobacco leaves, floral notes (magnolia seems to be the main floral note under my nose, ylang-ylang, rose as well ?), a touch of suede and aromatic peppery juniper berries (I detect several similatities of it with the more complex Penhaligon's Juniper Sling indeed). The Orphéon's aroma is slightly green/berrish aromatic, spicy (mostly cinnamon imo), definitely musky floral (in a melancholic spicy and sophisticated intense way) and soapy woody because of a central accord of silky tobacco and powdery notes. Woodiness, grassiness and florals provide a sort of featuring melancholic spicy woodsy aura really classy, reserved and sophisticated (despite the classic inspiration I detect as well that green floral musky sophistication you can notice in modern musky scents a la Lumiere Noire Pour Homme by Maison Francis Kurkdjian or Il Profvmo Black Dianthus). There is something vaguely sultry exotic in it, something in the middle between Armani Onde Mystére (2008) and Cartier La Panthére Edt (2018), something vaguely smelling like sweated skin previously moisturized and layered with soothing grassy-woody foams and creams. There is as well a classic musky chypré aura in this parfum, something vaguely conjuring classic floral chypré scents a la Molto Smalto (1993), Borsalino by Borsalino (1984), Calvin Klein Eternity men (1989) or Ysl Jazz (1988). Dry down is warm, berrish, woody and floral (on my skin virile and more masculine oriented). I'm surprised by duration which go beyond the 12 hours on my skin while sillage is somewhat moderate. Super recommended and a new favorite of mine from Diptyque. A fragrance perfect for signature if you are that kind of mysterious and elusive intellectual fellow drinking a gin lonely down a super classy jazz cafè. 7th July 2024281955Varanis RidariShow all reviewsDiptyque Orphéon (2021) feels more like a scent for the remembrance of older styles, best enjoyed by older fragrance enthusiasts, than anything contemporary and relevant to today's niche scene, which is honestly fine. Throwing people who've been with you a long time a bone for their loyalty is perfectly square, and that's mostly what Creed did with Viking (2017) too. Speaking of Creed, Orphéon feels the most like a modern update of a long-dead Creed eau de toilette by the name of Baie de Genièvre (1982), in that is has a rather unsweet and direct focus on juniper berry (which is what baie de genièvre means in French). In fact, if you look at the listed notes, baie de genièvre directly comes up in the top of the pyramid for the scent. Now, I'm not saying this is a 1 for 1 copy, but neither was Diptyque Oud Palao (2015) a direct copy of Balenciaga pour Homme (1990), despite equally feeling like a direct homage. The real backstory behind this juice is that Diptyque wanted to pay respect to the club Orphéon, which sadly closed amidst the global COVID-19 pandemic, and was a former hangout for employees at the Diptyque home base next door. That's honestly a really sweet and touching tribute to a local business that couldn't weather the storm, but provided some joy to the creative minds behind the brand, so I approve.Olivier Pescheux is either a fan of Baie de Genièvre, or someone must have ordered a lot of Tom Collins drinks at Orphéon, because juniper is definitely the focus here. You get that sharp medicinal note coupled with dry bergamot and some aldehydes, then jasmine hedione in the heart, offering a bit of clean contrast with the juniper spritz top. The old Creed plunged further into woody aromatics while Orphéon instead goes in a powdery woody direction, coupling ionones with a bit of Iso E Super and \"atlas cedar\" that then tops some leafy non-sweet tobacco-ish tonka, not entirely like what's in Versace The Dreamer (1996) or Dolce & Gabbana pour Homme (1994). If you like that clean, crisp 90's vibe, marry it to the early 80's macho juniper blast of Baie de Genièvre and you've basically got Orphéon in a nutshell. Late in the wear, the juniper mostly falls away, unlike how it lingers indefinitely in the Creed, but that's okay, as it's not trying to be a clone. What's so surprising here is the raw directness of this juniper, not overdosed with scratchy norlimbanol or sweetened to death like you see nowadays, which is why I think this is one intentionally for the \"old heads\". I really like it, and could see Orphéon being a signature for a mature man or at least one with tastes broader than today's \"compliments\" crowd. Wear time is about eight hours and sillage is moderate too, with the kind of vibe that could work all year.Of course, juniper fragrances overall are very common at multiple price points, so paying a premium for a Diptyque eau de parfum is going to require some suspense of normal frugality, or just extreme fondness for the brand. Discounters and gray market sellers ultimately get these below retail, but never buy if the price looks too good to be true as there are fakes, so still expect above three digits for a decent authentic bottle. I like this a lot if you can't guess, and while it's still pound-for-pound a bit of an expensive proposition given the type of scent it is and the performance it gives, I'd say paying retail for this is still less traumatic than buying a bottle of Creed Baie de Genièvre. Again, not entirely the same, so this cannot be a replacement for what is one of the better gray caps, but is definitely in the same rarefied wheelhouse. As for the club Orphéon itself, it must have been a pretty chill place if this is the smell people from Diptyque thought of to memorialize it, and not ten metric tons of Paco Rabanne 1 Million (2008), Dior Sauvage (2015), spilled fruity drinks, and sweat pumped into stifling air. Most certainly Orphéon wasn't the kind of \"mating rituals set to house drun and bass\" club that would necessitate the wearing of a \"banger\" in any case, which a kind of scent like this definitely is not. Sample and see for yourself.

The jasmine is pleasant and veers towards the greener end of the spectrum.After a while it becomes a bit less bright and sweeter, owing to a wood not which is ,mainly cedar, with touch of sandal feeling present too. The sweetness comes from a vanilla-and-tonka impression that is medium-bodied and neither very rich nor cloying. Hints of a smooth suede and whiffs of tobacco appear at times - possibly alluding to the establishment this creation was named after, a social gathering spot for employees of this House in the past. I get moderate sillage, good projection, and seven hours of longevity on my skin. A nice scent for spring, very agreeable and good for the office. It is a bit too generic at times to convince though. 2.75/52nd August 2021246158BavardShow all reviewsThis starts out as a screechy, fruity, musky synthetic. It evolves into a decent sandalwood-type base.This kind of synthetic reminds me of recently sampling the Ralph Lauren higher-priced line with a similar unapologetically sharp, billowing synthetic vibe. 19th July 2021245759ADVERTISEMENTBuzzlepuffShow all reviewsThe backstory for Orpheon reveals the perfume was created to honor the memory of a bar of the same name, located close enough to Diptyque offices that it became an important setting for the owners of this brand. To memorialize this \"second office\" Opheon is set upon a mixed Tonka base with a smokey velour soft backdrop which stained with jasmine perfumes and juniper aromatics to recreate the atmosphere of the place. Opheon does have an atmospheric smoke and perfumed memory with soft padded lounge chairs. It is an exotic and captivating scent that is a bit feminine and adventurous in character. As faithful to the place as Orpheon may be, I have to wonder does this fragrance represent my dreams or does it open a window to possibilities? \"Do I want to smell like this?\". No, I guess not.

I thought maybe the old sniffer might’ve been fatigued or something so I tried it again later on..I got a much different impression this time. Although it’s certainly not strong to me, it has a very present feeling. It has a very powerful feeling. I think that’s because it has a strong resemblance to Chanel no 5 in the opening. by the notes, not something I expected at all. However a note breakdown like this could have led to it smelling like literally anything. The last thing I was expecting though was a Chanel no 5. It’s certainly not a clone, but had I only have smelled it in this opening stage, and not the rest, I’d say so. It’s very aldehydic to me. It’s also a little smokey. Jasmine can sometimes smell like it’s burning though, and I mean this in a good way. I am very blunt with my words, and if I thought it smelled bad I would say so. This actually smells really good but it does smell like burning jasmines in the opening.After about 10 minutes on skin, the resemblance to Chanel no 5 is completely gone. It kinda just starts smelling like a generic shampoo at this point.. or perhaps one of those $7 roll on perfumes made by Al Rehab, that are heavily dependent on jasmine.. then get real soapy (if ya know, ya know!) it’s like a weaker version of one of those.. Aseel comes to mind. Projection, still bad here. Becoming more synthetic as it dries. It does have a Diptyque feel, there’s something very specific about all other fragrances that I kind of notice. It’s sort of similar to how Creed used to do signature ambergris. Idk if Dip is using ambergris, but there I do think there’s an ingredient in most of their fragrances, that connects them. I digress..so usually when I review a fragrance it’s something I’ve been wearing for a while. At least a week. There are times when I just wear it once and review it and usually I say so in that review if I do so. This is one of those reviews. I have only worn this Frag twice. The first time, I barely smelled anything and the second time, I wrote this review.Here I am now coming back to finish this review off after I dozed off for a couple hours. I can barely smell the base of those on my skin. Its just linear to me. it smells like smokey jasmine. I dont get any juniper, very little cedar, lots of tonka though. The base is a subtle sweetness and a little powdery. The slight hit of cedar gives it a little bit of a spice, enough to not make it smell super cheap. If they would’ve kicked up the cedar on this, or added more juniper it would have been a completely different fragrance and it would have been very good. if you’re finding my reviews lately to have a lot of typos, I assure you I’m not drunk, nor stupid. i’m just not in reach of my computers or laptops as of late I mostly dictate anything I do on Basenotes using my microphone on my iPhone. So pardon the typos. I dont have the patience to edit it all. Sometimes they make some pretty funny ones though. for a good laugh!Sorry, I love Diptyque, but I gotta call a spade, a spade.. this just sucks!Also this leans more feminine than masculine, but that does not impact my choice on rating, as I believe this is marketed as unisex anyways. (The reason I wanted to add this is because a lot of people who review unisex fragrances don’t really depict if they smell more masculine or more feminine)It’s the lack of originality, lack of performance, and overpriced for what you get. It smells nice though. Lasts 4 hours on my skin. Projects about a foot in the first hour, after that, skin scent.Sorry, but just smelling decent is not enough when your name is Diptyque. This is one of their newer ones, and is a big step back for such a brand. I think Diptyque knows that they have a very loyal following. And this is going to be a money grab for them. unfortunately a lot of people are going to be disappointed with this one.Lastly.. I just wanna say that it almost seems like Diptyque is in reverse mode compared to how Fragrance houses are. I mean you look back to the early releases into things that Philosykos came out in the mid 90’s.. it’s hard to fathom. So unique, so perfect. Where as now.. they’re baking stuff that smells like it was around in the 70s, like this and that Menthe one that smells like Drakkar. What are we doing Dip??

A modern but classically inspired fragrance full of allure and mystere. Orphéon Eau de Parfum by Diptyque is (marketed as unisex but mostly masculine to me) grassy musky floral Chypré fragrance with a distinguisced, assertive and vaguely nostalgic-melancholic soul. This fragrance is classy in a measured, \"silent\" and super balanced way. Despite marketed as unisex it is a fragrance better performing on a men imo (if you really want to take the most of it), although I have to assert that there is in it a sort of sophisticated musk/ylang-ylang oriented silky subtleness you can find out in many glorious feminine perfumes of the past (Fendi by Fendi, V&A First etc, just to quote several). Orphéon Eau de Parfum was launched in 2021and the nose behind this fragrance is the great Olivier Pescheux (Ex Nihilo, D&G, Versace, Ysl, Jil Sander, Lanvin, Moschino etc). Orphéon is told to evoke the smoky and warm atmosphere of an iconic night club bar in the Saint Germain Paris neighborhood and it is named behind it. To be honest I don't get any smoky vibe while I detect a complex floral presence (definitely more than the only jasmine), musk, pepper, juniper berries, ginger and lot more. Juniper berries is probably the main element and this fragrance definitely exalts this note and its implementation in perfumery. The fragrance is mostly focused on soapy talky cedarwood (woody notes plus soothing and powdery tonka bean and fresh soapy tobacco), tobacco leaves, floral notes (magnolia seems to be the main floral note under my nose, ylang-ylang, rose as well ?), a touch of suede and aromatic peppery juniper berries (I detect several similatities of it with the more complex Penhaligon's Juniper Sling indeed). The Orphéon's aroma is slightly green/berrish aromatic, spicy (mostly cinnamon imo), definitely musky floral (in a melancholic spicy and sophisticated intense way) and soapy woody because of a central accord of silky tobacco and powdery notes. Woodiness, grassiness and florals provide a sort of featuring melancholic spicy woodsy aura really classy, reserved and sophisticated (despite the classic inspiration I detect as well that green floral musky sophistication you can notice in modern musky scents a la Lumiere Noire Pour Homme by Maison Francis Kurkdjian or Il Profvmo Black Dianthus). There is something vaguely sultry exotic in it, something in the middle between Armani Onde Mystére (2008) and Cartier La Panthére Edt (2018), something vaguely smelling like sweated skin previously moisturized and layered with soothing grassy-woody foams and creams. There is as well a classic musky chypré aura in this parfum, something vaguely conjuring classic floral chypré scents a la Molto Smalto (1993), Borsalino by Borsalino (1984), Calvin Klein Eternity men (1989) or Ysl Jazz (1988). Dry down is warm, berrish, woody and floral (on my skin virile and more masculine oriented). I'm surprised by duration which go beyond the 12 hours on my skin while sillage is somewhat moderate. Super recommended and a new favorite of mine from Diptyque. A fragrance perfect for signature if you are that kind of mysterious and elusive intellectual fellow drinking a gin lonely down a super classy jazz cafè. 7th July 2024281955Varanis RidariShow all reviewsDiptyque Orphéon (2021) feels more like a scent for the remembrance of older styles, best enjoyed by older fragrance enthusiasts, than anything contemporary and relevant to today's niche scene, which is honestly fine. Throwing people who've been with you a long time a bone for their loyalty is perfectly square, and that's mostly what Creed did with Viking (2017) too. Speaking of Creed, Orphéon feels the most like a modern update of a long-dead Creed eau de toilette by the name of Baie de Genièvre (1982), in that is has a rather unsweet and direct focus on juniper berry (which is what baie de genièvre means in French). In fact, if you look at the listed notes, baie de genièvre directly comes up in the top of the pyramid for the scent. Now, I'm not saying this is a 1 for 1 copy, but neither was Diptyque Oud Palao (2015) a direct copy of Balenciaga pour Homme (1990), despite equally feeling like a direct homage. The real backstory behind this juice is that Diptyque wanted to pay respect to the club Orphéon, which sadly closed amidst the global COVID-19 pandemic, and was a former hangout for employees at the Diptyque home base next door. That's honestly a really sweet and touching tribute to a local business that couldn't weather the storm, but provided some joy to the creative minds behind the brand, so I approve.Olivier Pescheux is either a fan of Baie de Genièvre, or someone must have ordered a lot of Tom Collins drinks at Orphéon, because juniper is definitely the focus here. You get that sharp medicinal note coupled with dry bergamot and some aldehydes, then jasmine hedione in the heart, offering a bit of clean contrast with the juniper spritz top. The old Creed plunged further into woody aromatics while Orphéon instead goes in a powdery woody direction, coupling ionones with a bit of Iso E Super and \"atlas cedar\" that then tops some leafy non-sweet tobacco-ish tonka, not entirely like what's in Versace The Dreamer (1996) or Dolce & Gabbana pour Homme (1994). If you like that clean, crisp 90's vibe, marry it to the early 80's macho juniper blast of Baie de Genièvre and you've basically got Orphéon in a nutshell. Late in the wear, the juniper mostly falls away, unlike how it lingers indefinitely in the Creed, but that's okay, as it's not trying to be a clone. What's so surprising here is the raw directness of this juniper, not overdosed with scratchy norlimbanol or sweetened to death like you see nowadays, which is why I think this is one intentionally for the \"old heads\". I really like it, and could see Orphéon being a signature for a mature man or at least one with tastes broader than today's \"compliments\" crowd. Wear time is about eight hours and sillage is moderate too, with the kind of vibe that could work all year.Of course, juniper fragrances overall are very common at multiple price points, so paying a premium for a Diptyque eau de parfum is going to require some suspense of normal frugality, or just extreme fondness for the brand. Discounters and gray market sellers ultimately get these below retail, but never buy if the price looks too good to be true as there are fakes, so still expect above three digits for a decent authentic bottle. I like this a lot if you can't guess, and while it's still pound-for-pound a bit of an expensive proposition given the type of scent it is and the performance it gives, I'd say paying retail for this is still less traumatic than buying a bottle of Creed Baie de Genièvre. Again, not entirely the same, so this cannot be a replacement for what is one of the better gray caps, but is definitely in the same rarefied wheelhouse. As for the club Orphéon itself, it must have been a pretty chill place if this is the smell people from Diptyque thought of to memorialize it, and not ten metric tons of Paco Rabanne 1 Million (2008), Dior Sauvage (2015), spilled fruity drinks, and sweat pumped into stifling air. Most certainly Orphéon wasn't the kind of \"mating rituals set to house drun and bass\" club that would necessitate the wearing of a \"banger\" in any case, which a kind of scent like this definitely is not. Sample and see for yourself.

The jasmine is pleasant and veers towards the greener end of the spectrum.After a while it becomes a bit less bright and sweeter, owing to a wood not which is ,mainly cedar, with touch of sandal feeling present too. The sweetness comes from a vanilla-and-tonka impression that is medium-bodied and neither very rich nor cloying. Hints of a smooth suede and whiffs of tobacco appear at times - possibly alluding to the establishment this creation was named after, a social gathering spot for employees of this House in the past. I get moderate sillage, good projection, and seven hours of longevity on my skin. A nice scent for spring, very agreeable and good for the office. It is a bit too generic at times to convince though. 2.75/52nd August 2021246158BavardShow all reviewsThis starts out as a screechy, fruity, musky synthetic. It evolves into a decent sandalwood-type base.This kind of synthetic reminds me of recently sampling the Ralph Lauren higher-priced line with a similar unapologetically sharp, billowing synthetic vibe. 19th July 2021245759ADVERTISEMENTBuzzlepuffShow all reviewsThe backstory for Orpheon reveals the perfume was created to honor the memory of a bar of the same name, located close enough to Diptyque offices that it became an important setting for the owners of this brand. To memorialize this \"second office\" Opheon is set upon a mixed Tonka base with a smokey velour soft backdrop which stained with jasmine perfumes and juniper aromatics to recreate the atmosphere of the place. Opheon does have an atmospheric smoke and perfumed memory with soft padded lounge chairs. It is an exotic and captivating scent that is a bit feminine and adventurous in character. As faithful to the place as Orpheon may be, I have to wonder does this fragrance represent my dreams or does it open a window to possibilities? \"Do I want to smell like this?\". No, I guess not.

I thought maybe the old sniffer might’ve been fatigued or something so I tried it again later on..I got a much different impression this time. Although it’s certainly not strong to me, it has a very present feeling. It has a very powerful feeling. I think that’s because it has a strong resemblance to Chanel no 5 in the opening. by the notes, not something I expected at all. However a note breakdown like this could have led to it smelling like literally anything. The last thing I was expecting though was a Chanel no 5. It’s certainly not a clone, but had I only have smelled it in this opening stage, and not the rest, I’d say so. It’s very aldehydic to me. It’s also a little smokey. Jasmine can sometimes smell like it’s burning though, and I mean this in a good way. I am very blunt with my words, and if I thought it smelled bad I would say so. This actually smells really good but it does smell like burning jasmines in the opening.After about 10 minutes on skin, the resemblance to Chanel no 5 is completely gone. It kinda just starts smelling like a generic shampoo at this point.. or perhaps one of those $7 roll on perfumes made by Al Rehab, that are heavily dependent on jasmine.. then get real soapy (if ya know, ya know!) it’s like a weaker version of one of those.. Aseel comes to mind. Projection, still bad here. Becoming more synthetic as it dries. It does have a Diptyque feel, there’s something very specific about all other fragrances that I kind of notice. It’s sort of similar to how Creed used to do signature ambergris. Idk if Dip is using ambergris, but there I do think there’s an ingredient in most of their fragrances, that connects them. I digress..so usually when I review a fragrance it’s something I’ve been wearing for a while. At least a week. There are times when I just wear it once and review it and usually I say so in that review if I do so. This is one of those reviews. I have only worn this Frag twice. The first time, I barely smelled anything and the second time, I wrote this review.Here I am now coming back to finish this review off after I dozed off for a couple hours. I can barely smell the base of those on my skin. Its just linear to me. it smells like smokey jasmine. I dont get any juniper, very little cedar, lots of tonka though. The base is a subtle sweetness and a little powdery. The slight hit of cedar gives it a little bit of a spice, enough to not make it smell super cheap. If they would’ve kicked up the cedar on this, or added more juniper it would have been a completely different fragrance and it would have been very good. if you’re finding my reviews lately to have a lot of typos, I assure you I’m not drunk, nor stupid. i’m just not in reach of my computers or laptops as of late I mostly dictate anything I do on Basenotes using my microphone on my iPhone. So pardon the typos. I dont have the patience to edit it all. Sometimes they make some pretty funny ones though. for a good laugh!Sorry, I love Diptyque, but I gotta call a spade, a spade.. this just sucks!Also this leans more feminine than masculine, but that does not impact my choice on rating, as I believe this is marketed as unisex anyways. (The reason I wanted to add this is because a lot of people who review unisex fragrances don’t really depict if they smell more masculine or more feminine)It’s the lack of originality, lack of performance, and overpriced for what you get. It smells nice though. Lasts 4 hours on my skin. Projects about a foot in the first hour, after that, skin scent.Sorry, but just smelling decent is not enough when your name is Diptyque. This is one of their newer ones, and is a big step back for such a brand. I think Diptyque knows that they have a very loyal following. And this is going to be a money grab for them. unfortunately a lot of people are going to be disappointed with this one.Lastly.. I just wanna say that it almost seems like Diptyque is in reverse mode compared to how Fragrance houses are. I mean you look back to the early releases into things that Philosykos came out in the mid 90’s.. it’s hard to fathom. So unique, so perfect. Where as now.. they’re baking stuff that smells like it was around in the 70s, like this and that Menthe one that smells like Drakkar. What are we doing Dip??
